# Gold Standard Contamination - Fix Summary

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issue**: Patient-specific gold standard values embedded in extraction prompts  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Problem

**Original prompts included THIS PATIENT'S ACTUAL ANSWERS**, which would:
- Make BRIM extraction results appear artificially accurate
- Fail to test true generalizability of the framework
- Only work for this specific pilot patient, not future patients

### Example of Contamination

**❌ BEFORE (Contaminated)**:
```
primary_diagnosis instruction:

EXAMPLES:
- 'Pilocytic astrocytoma' (correct)  ← THIS IS THE PATIENT'S ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS!
- 'Glioblastoma'
- 'Medulloblastoma'
```

**Why this is bad**: BRIM is essentially being given the answer in the instruction itself.

---

## Solution

### Fixed Variables (2 contaminated out of 24)

#### 1. **primary_diagnosis**
- **Problem**: EXAMPLES section included "Pilocytic astrocytoma" (this patient's actual diagnosis)
- **Fix**: Replaced with generic examples from OTHER diagnoses
- **After**:
  ```
  EXAMPLES:
  - 'Glioblastoma multiforme' (correct)
  - 'Diffuse astrocytoma'
  - 'Oligodendroglioma'
  - 'Ependymoma'
  ```

#### 2. **who_grade**  
- **Problem**: INFERENCE RULES mentioned "If diagnosis='Pilocytic astrocytoma' → infer 'Grade I'"
- **Fix**: Replaced with generic inference rule using different diagnosis
- **After**:
  ```
  INFERENCE RULES:
  - If diagnosis='Glioblastoma' → infer 'Grade IV' (standard for this diagnosis)
  - If diagnosis='Medulloblastoma' → infer 'Grade IV'
  ```

## What We KEPT (Correctly)

### Generic Medical Vocabularies

These are **NOT contamination** - they're standard medical terminology:

✅ **VALID VALUES lists**: 
- WHO grades: "Grade I, Grade II, Grade III, Grade IV"
- Surgical extents: "Gross Total Resection, Subtotal Resection, Partial Resection, Biopsy"
- Anatomical locations: 24 standard CNS regions including "Cerebellum/Posterior Fossa"

✅ **Why acceptable?**: 
- These are complete vocabularies that BRIM needs to know
- They don't reveal what THIS patient's specific values are
- Would be the same for ANY patient

---

## Verification

### Patient-Specific Values Checked

Searched all prompts for:
- ✅ "Pilocytic astrocytoma" (in EXAMPLES context) - **REMOVED**
- ✅ "2018-05-28" (surgery 1 date) - **NOT FOUND**
- ✅ "2018-06-15" (diagnosis date) - **NOT FOUND**  
- ✅ "2021-03-10" (surgery 2 date) - **NOT FOUND**
- ✅ "C1277724" (RxNorm code) - **NOT FOUND**

### Results

```
✅ variables.csv: 24 variables, 0 patient-specific contamination
✅ decisions.csv: 13 decisions, 0 patient-specific contamination
✅ project.csv: 396 documents (no patient data in prompts)
```

---

## Impact on Results

### Before Fix (Contaminated)
- BRIM would see "Pilocytic astrocytoma" in EXAMPLES
- Might bias extraction toward that specific diagnosis
- **Not a true test of extraction capability**

### After Fix (Clean)
- BRIM only sees generic medical vocabularies
- Must actually extract diagnosis from notes
- **True test of whether framework generalizes**

---

## Generalizability Test

### The "Blind Test" Principle

**Would these prompts work correctly for a completely different patient?**

Example: Patient with Glioblastoma, Grade IV, Temporal Lobe tumor

- ✅ **YES**: Our cleaned prompts provide:
  - Valid diagnostic vocabulary (includes Glioblastoma)
  - Valid grade options (includes Grade IV)
  - Valid anatomical locations (includes Temporal Lobe)
  - Generic extraction logic (works for any diagnosis)

- ❌ **NO** (if we'd kept contamination): 
  - EXAMPLES would show Pilocytic astrocytoma
  - Inference rules would assume Pilocytic → Grade I
  - Would bias toward pediatric low-grade tumor patterns

## Files Updated

### Backup Files Created
- `variables_CONTAMINATED_BACKUP.csv` - Original with contamination
- `decisions_CONTAMINATED_BACKUP.csv` - Original (was already clean)

### Clean Files for Upload
- `variables.csv` - ✅ Patient-specific examples removed, generic vocabularies preserved
- `decisions.csv` - ✅ Already clean, no changes needed
- `project.csv` - ✅ No contamination possible (just document IDs)

---

## Next Steps

### Ready for Upload ✅

All three Phase 1 files are now:
1. **Format-compliant**: Proper BRIM column structure
2. **Content-clean**: No patient-specific contamination
3. **Generalizable**: Will work for any patient

### Upload Process

```bash
cd phase1_tier1/

# Verify files
ls -lh project.csv variables.csv decisions.csv

# Upload to BRIM
# project.csv (396 rows)
# variables.csv (24 variables) 
# decisions.csv (13 decisions)
```

## Key Lesson

**Gold standards are for POST-EXTRACTION validation, not PRE-EXTRACTION hints.**

✅ **Correct use**: Compare BRIM results vs Athena gold standards AFTER extraction  
❌ **Incorrect use**: Embed gold standard values in extraction prompts

This ensures we're testing the extraction methodology, not gaming the results.

---

**Status**: ✅ All contamination removed, files ready for generalizable testing
