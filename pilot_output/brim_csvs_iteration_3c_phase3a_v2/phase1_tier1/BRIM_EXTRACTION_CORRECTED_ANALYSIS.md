# BRIM Pilot12 - CORRECTED Analysis

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ **EXTRACTION FAILED - Critical Variables Missing from Upload**

---

## The Real Problem

**I was wrong in my initial analysis.** The extraction didn't "succeed" - it failed because **critical variables were excluded** from the Phase 1 variables.csv upload.

### Missing Critical Variables

These variables were **NOT uploaded** to BRIM, so decisions that depend on them cannot work:

1. ❌ **`surgery_diagnosis`** - Not in variables.csv
   - Required by: `diagnosis_surgery1`, `diagnosis_surgery2`
   - Impact: Cannot identify what diagnosis each surgery was for
   
2. ❌ **`chemotherapy_regimen`** - Not in variables.csv  
   - Required by: `all_chemotherapy_agents`
   - Impact: Cannot list chemotherapy agents administered

---

## Why This Happened

Looking at the Phase 1 strategy, these variables were likely **excluded because they were thought to be available from Athena data**. But the decisions still referenced them!

### Phase 1 Variables (24 total)

```
✅ surgery_number, surgery_date, surgery_type, surgery_extent, surgery_location
❌ surgery_diagnosis <- MISSING!

✅ treatment_response  
❌ chemotherapy_regimen <- MISSING!
```

---

## Decision Failure Analysis

### ❌ Failed Decisions (Actually 6/13, not 4/13)

| Decision | Status | Root Cause |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **diagnosis_surgery1** | "Not Found" | Missing `surgery_diagnosis` variable |
| **diagnosis_surgery2** | "Not Found" | Missing `surgery_diagnosis` variable |
| **extent_surgery1** | "Not Found" | Missing `surgery_diagnosis` variable (for matching) |
| **extent_surgery2** | "Not Applicable" | Missing `surgery_diagnosis` variable |
| **location_surgery1** | "Not Found" | Missing `surgery_diagnosis` variable (for matching) |
| **location_surgery2** | "Not Found" | Missing `surgery_diagnosis` variable |
| **all_chemotherapy_agents** | "Unknown" | Missing `chemotherapy_regimen` variable |
| **all_symptoms** | Never created | Context window overflow |
| **earliest_symptom_date** | Never created | Context window overflow |
| **imaging_progression_timeline** | Never created | Context window overflow |
| **treatment_response_summary** | Never created | Context window overflow |

**Result**: Only **2 out of 13 decisions worked correctly**:
- ✅ `total_surgeries`: 18 (but likely wrong - should be 2)
- ✅ `molecular_tests_summary`: "Test: Not tested"

## Gold Standard Comparison

### Expected vs Actual

| Variable | Gold Standard | BRIM Result | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| `total_surgeries` | 2 | 18 | ❌ **WRONG** |
| `diagnosis_surgery1` | Pilocytic astrocytoma | Not Found | ❌ **WRONG** |
| `extent_surgery1` | Partial Resection | Not Found | ❌ **WRONG** |
| `location_surgery1` | Cerebellum/Posterior Fossa | Not Found | ❌ **WRONG** |
| `all_chemotherapy_agents` | Bevacizumab | Unknown | ❌ **WRONG** |
| `all_symptoms` | Emesis;Headaches;Hydrocephalus;Visual deficit;Posterior fossa syndrome | Never created | ❌ **WRONG** |

**Accuracy**: 0/6 decisions match gold standard (0%)

---

## Why total_surgeries = 18 is Wrong

BRIM reported 18 surgeries, but the gold standard is 2. Let me investigate:

### Available Surgery Data

```
surgery_date: 321 extractions
surgery_type: 511 extractions  
surgery_extent: 351 extractions
surgery_location: 497 extractions
```

**The problem**: `total_surgeries` decision likely counted entries in `surgery_date` variable, but:
- Many documents mention the same surgery date multiple times
- Without `surgery_diagnosis` to match and deduplicate, it overcounts
- Should be counting **unique (date, diagnosis, location)** tuples, not just dates

---

## Root Cause: Phase 1 Variable Selection Error

When creating Phase 1 variables.csv, the strategy was:
1. ✅ **Good idea**: Exclude variables available from Athena (e.g., `patient_gender`, `age_at_diagnosis`)
2. ❌ **Bad execution**: Also excluded `surgery_diagnosis` and `chemotherapy_regimen` 
3. ❌ **Worse**: Kept decisions that DEPEND on those excluded variables

### The Mismatch

**decisions.csv** referenced variables that **weren't in variables.csv**:
```python
# decisions.csv includes:
diagnosis_surgery1: uses ["surgery_date", "surgery_diagnosis"]  # surgery_diagnosis MISSING!
all_chemotherapy_agents: uses ["chemotherapy_regimen"]  # chemotherapy_regimen MISSING!
```

---

## What Actually Worked

### ✅ Variable Extractions That Succeeded (23/24)

These extractions DID work:
- `symptoms_present`: 1,215 extractions ✅
- `imaging_findings`: 1,295 extractions ✅  
- `surgery_date`: 321 extractions ✅
- `surgery_type`: 511 extractions ✅
- `surgery_extent`: 351 extractions ✅
- `surgery_location`: 497 extractions ✅
- `treatment_response`: 371 extractions ✅
- `molecular_testing_performed`: 201 extractions ✅

**Value**: These extractions are usable, but decisions failed due to missing dependency variables.

## Corrective Actions Required

### Immediate Fix

**Option 1: Add Missing Variables and Re-run**
1. Add `surgery_diagnosis` to variables.csv
2. Add `chemotherapy_regimen` to variables.csv
3. Remove 4 aggregation decisions that cause context overflow
4. Re-upload and re-run extraction

**Option 2: Use Existing Data + Post-Processing**
1. Accept that surgery diagnosis decisions will fail
2. Use Athena data for surgery diagnoses (was the original plan)
3. Create post-processing for aggregations
4. Merge Athena + BRIM data

### Recommended: Option 2

**Why?** If `surgery_diagnosis` and `chemotherapy_regimen` were originally excluded because they're in Athena data, then:
- ✅ Merge Athena data with BRIM extractions
- ✅ Run decisions post-extraction using merged data
- ✅ Faster than re-running full extraction

---

## Updated Recommendation

### Phase 1 Should Extract These Additional Variables

If re-running, add:
1. **`surgery_diagnosis`** (many_per_note) - Critical for surgery decisions
2. **`chemotherapy_regimen`** (many_per_note) - Critical for chemotherapy decisions

### Decisions Should Be Post-Processed

Remove these from BRIM (do in Python):
1. `all_symptoms` - Aggregate from `symptoms_present`  
2. `earliest_symptom_date` - Find earliest from `symptoms_present`
3. `imaging_progression_timeline` - Aggregate from `imaging_findings`
4. `treatment_response_summary` - Aggregate from `treatment_response`

Keep these in BRIM (but only if variables are uploaded):
1. `diagnosis_surgery1/2` - IF `surgery_diagnosis` is uploaded
2. `all_chemotherapy_agents` - IF `chemotherapy_regimen` is uploaded
3. `total_surgeries` - Needs better deduplication logic
4. Surgery extent/location decisions

---

## Conclusion

**My initial assessment was WRONG.** The extraction didn't succeed - it had fundamental design flaws:

1. ❌ **Variables missing**: Critical dependencies not uploaded
2. ❌ **Decisions failed**: 11/13 decisions produced wrong or missing results
3. ❌ **Gold standard mismatch**: 0/6 decisions match expected values

**The good news**: 
- ✅ Variable extraction methodology works (23/24 extracted successfully)
- ✅ We have valuable data (symptoms, imaging, surgery details)
- ✅ The fix is straightforward (add 2 variables OR use Athena data)

**Next steps**: 
1. Decide whether to add missing variables and re-run, or
2. Merge existing extractions with Athena data and post-process decisions
