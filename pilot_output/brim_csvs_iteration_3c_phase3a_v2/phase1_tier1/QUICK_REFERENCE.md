## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Files
```bash
cd phase1_tier1
wc -l project.csv variables.csv decisions.csv
# Expected: 397 project.csv, 26 variables.csv, 14 decisions.csv
```

### Step 2: Upload to BRIM
1. Open BRIM
2. Create project: "BRIM_Pilot9_Phase1_Tier1"
3. Upload: `project.csv`, `variables.csv`, `decisions.csv`
4. Start extraction

### Step 3: Monitor (2-4 hours)
- 30 min: ~25-30% complete (~1,000-1,500 rows)
- 1 hour: ~40-50% complete (~2,000-2,500 rows)
- 2 hours: ~70-80% complete (~3,500-4,000 rows)
- 3-4 hours: ✅ Complete (~5,000-7,000 rows)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why is decisions.csv the same as the original?
**A**: Decisions operate on extracted variables, not documents. The post-processing logic works the same whether we extract from 391 or 3,865 documents. The decisions filter and aggregate whatever variables BRIM successfully extracts.

### Q: What are the 8 Athena-prepopulated variables?
**A**: Demographics (5): patient_gender, date_of_birth, age_at_diagnosis, race, ethnicity  
Medications (3): chemotherapy_received, chemotherapy_agents, concomitant_medications

These are in `athena_prepopulated_values.json` and will be merged with Phase 1 results after extraction.

### Q: What if Phase 1 doesn't capture all variables?
**A**: If <80% of the 25 variables are complete, we'll run Phase 2 with Tier 2 documents (broader set) focusing only on incomplete variables. This is unlikely given Tier 1's high value.

### Q: How do I validate Phase 1 results?
**A**: Download the extraction results and compare against the Athena reference files. A validation script example is in `README_PHASE1_FOLDER.md`.

### Q: Can I regenerate these files?
**A**: Yes! All 3 generation scripts are included. See the "How to regenerate" section in `README_PHASE1_FOLDER.md`.

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Phase 1 is successful if**:
- [ ] Extraction completes in 2-4 hours (vs 10-15 hours original)
- [ ] ≥20 of 25 variables have data (≥80% completeness)
- [ ] Quality ≥95% success rate (matches partial extraction)
- [ ] Combined with Athena: 28-33 of 33 total variables complete
- [ ] Gold standard validation confirms accuracy

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

**After Phase 1 + Athena merge**:
- Total variables: 28-33 of 33 (85-100% complete)
- Total time: 3-5 hours (including validation)
- Total cost: $50-80 (vs $150-300)
- Workflow: Documented and reproducible
- Quality: Maintained or improved

**Phase 2 needed?**: Unlikely (Tier 1 captures ~90% of clinical value)

---

## 📞 Next Steps After Extraction

1. **Download results** from BRIM
2. **Save as**: `phase1_extraction_results.csv`
3. **Validate**: Run validation script (see `README_PHASE1_FOLDER.md`)
4. **Merge**: Combine with `athena_prepopulated_values.json`
5. **Assess**: ≥28 variables complete? → Done! <28? → Consider Phase 2
6. **Document**: Commit results to GitHub with summary
