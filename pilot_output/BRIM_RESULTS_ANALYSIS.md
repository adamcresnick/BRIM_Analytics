---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL/NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

#### 7. **extent_of_resection** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Extracted:** `not specified` (2x), `gross total resection` (1x)
- **Raw Text:** Mixed - surgical changes, "gross total resection of enhancing cystic structures"
- **Assessment:** 
  - ‚úÖ Correctly identified GTR in radiology report
  - ‚ùå Marked as "not specified" for descriptive surgical changes that don't explicitly state resection extent
- **Issue:** Conservative interpretation may miss implicit resection information
- **Action:** 
  - Enhance instruction to infer resection extent from surgical cavity descriptions
  - Add examples of indirect resection evidence (e.g., "surgical cavity" suggests resection occurred)

#### 8. **document_type** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Extracted:** `RADIOLOGY`
- **Raw Text:** MRI reports, but also includes "text=Vital Signs", "text=Consult Note", "text=Lab"
- **Assessment:**
  - ‚úÖ Correctly identified radiology as most frequent
  - ‚ùå Ignored other document types present in the FHIR Bundle
- **Issue:** The "many labels per note" scope should have extracted multiple document types
- **Action:**
  - Clarify that FHIR_BUNDLE contains multiple document types
  - Instruction should extract each document type separately
  - Consider changing scope or aggregation strategy

#### 9. **date_of_birth** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Extracted:** `Not documented`
- **Raw Text:** "19 yo female" mentioned in clinical notes
- **Assessment:**
  - ‚ùå Failed to extract DOB despite clear age reference (19 years old)
  - ‚ùå Reasoning states "no Patient resource" but age is in clinical text
- **Issue:** Instruction only looks for explicit DOB/dates, not age that can be used to calculate approximate DOB
- **Action:**
  - Update instruction to extract age if DOB not available
  - Add logic to calculate approximate birth year from age and note date
  - Example: "19 yo" in 2024 ‚Üí approximate DOB ~2005

### ‚ùå FAILED EXTRACTIONS (Unknown/Default Values)

#### 10. **idh_mutation** ‚ùå
- **Extracted:** `unknown`
- **Raw Text:** None
- **Assessment:** No molecular testing data in FHIR Bundle
- **Issue:** FHIR data doesn't contain Observation resources with molecular markers
- **Root Cause:** Data source limitation - molecular results may be in:
  - Separate Observation resources not included in Bundle
  - Clinical notes as unstructured text (not parsed)
  - External pathology reports not integrated
- **Action:**
  - Add DocumentReference text extraction to search clinical notes
  - Look for patterns: "IDH wildtype", "IDH mutant", "IDH1 R132H"
  - Consider adding Observation resources to FHIR extraction

#### 11. **mgmt_methylation** ‚ùå
- **Extracted:** `unknown`
- **Raw Text:** None
- **Assessment:** Similar to IDH - no molecular data
- **Issue:** Same data source limitation
- **Action:**
  - Search clinical notes for "MGMT methylated", "MGMT unmethylated"
  - Add pathology report text extraction

#### 12. **diagnosis_date** ‚ùå
- **Extracted:** `unknown`
- **Raw Text:** None (but likely in Condition resources)
- **Assessment:** Failed to extract despite likely presence in FHIR Condition.onsetDateTime
- **Issue:** Instruction may not be properly querying Condition resources
- **Action:**
  - Verify FHIR Condition resources are in project.csv
  - Update instruction to explicitly look for Condition.onsetDateTime
  - Fallback to earliest surgery date or clinical note mention

#### 13. **radiation_therapy** ‚ùå
- **Extracted:** `false`
- **Raw Text:** None
- **Assessment:** May be false negative - need to verify
- **Issue:** 
  - No radiation Procedure resources in FHIR Bundle, OR
  - Radiation mentioned in clinical notes but not extracted
- **Action:**
  - Search DocumentReference texts for radiation keywords
  - Look for: "radiation", "XRT", "IMRT", "stereotactic", "Gy"
  - Verify if patient actually received radiation (ground truth needed)

## Decision Variable Analysis

### ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 14. **total_surgeries** ‚ùå CRITICAL
- **Extracted:** `0`
- **Expected:** At least `2` (two surgery dates on 2021-03-10)
- **Raw Text:** Shows surgery_date entries with valid dates
- **Assessment:** **MAJOR BUG** - Count logic completely failed
- **Issue:** 
  - Decision instruction asks to count "unique surgical procedures"
  - LLM reasoning: "does not include any details about types or names"
  - Bug: Despite having surgery_date evidence, returned 0
- **Root Cause:**
  - Instruction unclear about what constitutes a "unique" surgery
  - May be requiring both date AND type to count
  - Aggregation logic not properly counting surgery_date entries
- **Action:** üö® HIGH PRIORITY
  - Simplify instruction: "Count the number of unique surgery dates"
  - Or: "Count all surgery_type entries that are not 'OTHER'"
  - Add explicit examples in instruction
  - Test with current data to verify fix

#### 15. **best_resection** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Extracted:** `DEBULKING`
- **Expected:** Possibly `gross total resection` (GTR mentioned in radiology)
- **Assessment:** Reasonable but may be inaccurate
- **Issue:**
  - Chose DEBULKING from surgery_type over GTR from extent_of_resection
  - Reasoning: "DEBULKING is more extensive than OTHER"
  - But: Radiology report clearly states "gross total resection"
- **Root Cause:**
  - Decision depends on both surgery_type and extent_of_resection
  - Unclear which source to prioritize (operative note vs. radiology interpretation)
- **Action:**
  - Update instruction to prioritize extent_of_resection over surgery_type
  - Hierarchy: GTR > Near Total > Subtotal > Debulking > Biopsy
  - Add clinical context: radiology confirmation often more accurate than procedure coding

#### 16. **confirmed_diagnosis** ‚úÖ
- **Extracted:** `Pilocytic astrocytoma of cerebellum`
- **Assessment:** Correct aggregation from primary_diagnosis
- **Action:** None needed

#### 17. **molecular_profile** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Extracted:** `IDH mutation status: unknown`
- **Assessment:** Correctly aggregated from idh_mutation
- **Issue:** Inherits failure from base variable
- **Action:** Fix idh_mutation extraction first

#### 18. **chemotherapy_regimen** ‚úÖ
- **Extracted:** `Selumetinib`
- **Assessment:** Correct aggregation from chemotherapy_agent
- **Action:** None needed

## Priority Issues Ranked

### üö® CRITICAL (Must Fix)
1. **total_surgeries = 0** - Completely wrong, blocks analysis
2. **date_of_birth = "Not documented"** - Age present but not extracted

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY (Significant Impact)
3. **best_resection** - May be wrong (DEBULKING vs GTR)
4. **surgery_type includes anesthesia** - Noise in data
5. **extent_of_resection** - Too conservative, missing implicit evidence

### üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY (Data Completeness)
6. **idh_mutation = unknown** - Need text extraction from clinical notes
7. **mgmt_methylation = unknown** - Need text extraction
8. **diagnosis_date = unknown** - Should be extractable from Condition resources
9. **radiation_therapy = false** - Need text extraction to verify

### üí° LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
10. **document_type** - Should extract multiple types, not just most frequent

## Proposed Variable Instruction Updates

### 1. Fix total_surgeries Decision
**Current Instruction:**
```
Count the total number of unique surgical procedures the patient has undergone. 
Use the surgery_type and surgery_date variables.
```

**Updated Instruction:**
```
Count the total number of unique surgical procedures by counting distinct surgery_date 
values where surgery_type is NOT 'OTHER'. If multiple surgery_type entries exist for 
the same date, count as one surgery. Return the count as a number (e.g., "1", "2", "3").

Examples:
- surgery_date: 2021-03-10, surgery_type: DEBULKING ‚Üí count = 1
- surgery_date: 2021-03-10 (2x), surgery_type: DEBULKING, OTHER ‚Üí count = 1 
- surgery_date: 2021-03-10, 2022-05-15, surgery_type: DEBULKING, RESECTION ‚Üí count = 2
```

### 2. Fix date_of_birth Variable
**Current Instruction:**
```
Extract the patient's date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format from the Patient resource 
in the FHIR Bundle. Look for Patient.birthDate. If not found, return "Not documented".
```

**Updated Instruction:**
```
Extract the patient's date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format. Priority order:

1. FHIR Patient.birthDate (if available) - exact date
2. Age mentioned in clinical text (e.g., "19 yo", "35 year old") - calculate approximate 
   birth year by subtracting age from current note date year, use YYYY-01-01 format
3. If neither available, return "Not documented"

Examples:
- Patient.birthDate: "2005-03-15" ‚Üí "2005-03-15"
- "19 yo female" in 2024 ‚Üí "2005-01-01" (approximate)
- No age or DOB ‚Üí "Not documented"
```

### 3. Enhance extent_of_resection Variable
**Current Instruction:**
```
Determine the extent of surgical resection from radiology reports or operative notes. 
Options: gross total resection, near total resection, subtotal resection, biopsy only, not specified.
```

**Updated Instruction:**
```
Determine the extent of surgical resection from radiology reports or operative notes. 
Look for explicit statements AND indirect evidence.

**Explicit evidence:**
- "gross total resection", "complete resection", "GTR"
- "near total resection", "NTR", "95% resection"
- "subtotal resection", "STR", "partial resection"
- "biopsy", "needle biopsy"

**Indirect evidence:**
- "surgical cavity", "resection bed", "postoperative changes" ‚Üí likely resection occurred
- "enhancing cystic structures...gross total resection" ‚Üí GTR
- "residual tumor", "incomplete resection" ‚Üí subtotal

Return: gross total resection | near total resection | subtotal resection | biopsy only | not specified

Only use "not specified" if no direct or indirect evidence exists.
```

### 4. Filter surgery_type to Exclude Non-Surgical Procedures
**Current Instruction:**
```
Classify surgical procedure types from FHIR Procedure resources. 
Options: BIOPSY, DEBULKING, RESECTION, SHUNT, OTHER.
```

**Updated Instruction:**
```
Classify surgical procedure types from FHIR Procedure resources. Ignore non-surgical 
procedures like anesthesia, nursing orders, or administrative entries.

**Include:**
- Craniotomy, craniectomy procedures
- Tumor resection, debulking, excision
- Biopsy procedures  
- Shunt placement
- Any procedure with "SURGERY", "RESECTION", "CRANIOTOMY" in the name

**Exclude (mark as OTHER or skip):**
- Anesthesia procedures (ANES...)
- Surgical case requests/orders (administrative)
- Pre-operative or post-operative care orders
- Nursing procedures

Options: BIOPSY | DEBULKING | RESECTION | SHUNT | OTHER

If excluded, do not create an entry.
```

### 5. Update best_resection Decision to Prioritize Clinical Evidence
**Current Instruction:**
```
Aggregate surgery_type and extent_of_resection to determine the most extensive resection. 
Priority: GTR > Near Total > Subtotal > Debulking > Biopsy.
```

**Updated Instruction:**
```
Determine the most extensive resection the patient received by combining surgery_type 
and extent_of_resection variables. Prioritize radiological confirmation over procedure coding.

**Priority Order (most to least extensive):**
1. gross total resection (if in extent_of_resection)
2. near total resection (if in extent_of_resection)
3. subtotal resection (if in extent_of_resection)
4. RESECTION (from surgery_type)
5. DEBULKING (from surgery_type)
6. BIOPSY (from surgery_type or extent_of_resection)

**Logic:**
- If extent_of_resection contains GTR/NTR/STR, use that (radiology-confirmed)
- Otherwise, use highest-priority surgery_type
- If multiple surgeries, return the most extensive one

Examples:
- extent_of_resection: "gross total resection", surgery_type: DEBULKING ‚Üí GTR
- extent_of_resection: "not specified", surgery_type: RESECTION, DEBULKING ‚Üí RESECTION
- extent_of_resection: "subtotal resection", surgery_type: BIOPSY ‚Üí subtotal resection
```

### 6. Add Text Extraction for Molecular Markers
**New instruction for idh_mutation:**
```
Extract IDH mutation status from pathology reports, molecular testing results, or 
clinical notes. Look for both structured FHIR Observation resources and unstructured text.

**Search patterns in text:**
- "IDH wildtype", "IDH wild-type", "IDH WT" ‚Üí wildtype
- "IDH mutant", "IDH mutation", "IDH1 R132H", "IDH2" ‚Üí mutant
- "IDH: negative", "no IDH mutation" ‚Üí wildtype
- Negative mentions: "IDH testing not performed", "pending" ‚Üí unknown

**Search in:**
1. FHIR Observation resources with code related to IDH
2. Pathology report text (DocumentReference)
3. Clinical note text mentioning "IDH" or "molecular"

Return: wildtype | mutant | unknown
```

## Conclusion

The BRIM pilot extraction demonstrates strong performance on core clinical variables 
(diagnosis, surgery, demographics) but has critical issues with decision aggregation 
(total_surgeries = 0) and gaps in molecular marker extraction. 

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ 6/13 variables extracted accurately
- ‚ùå 2/5 decisions have significant errors
- üìä Estimated current accuracy: ~60-70%
- üéØ Target accuracy: 90%+

**Priority Fixes:**
1. Fix total_surgeries counting logic (critical bug)
2. Enhance date_of_birth to use age when DOB unavailable
3. Improve extent_of_resection and best_resection accuracy
4. Add text extraction for molecular markers

With API integration and iterative improvement, we can systematically address these 
issues and achieve production-ready accuracy.
