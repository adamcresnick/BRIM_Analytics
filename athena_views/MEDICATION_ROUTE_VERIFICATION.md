### Routes Relevant to Chemotherapy

**High Priority** (systemic chemotherapy):
- ✅ **Intravenous** (46.7%) - Most chemotherapy
- ✅ **Oral** (28.0%) - Oral chemotherapy agents
- ✅ **Intramuscular** (0.9%) - Some chemotherapy
- ✅ **Subcutaneous** (1.3%) - Some chemotherapy

**Special Routes** (CNS-directed therapy):
- ⚠️ **Intrathecal** - Not in top 20, but critical for CNS chemotherapy
- ⚠️ **Intracavitary** - Not in top 20, but used for GLIADEL wafers

**Support Routes** (not chemotherapy):
- Topical, Transdermal, Inhaled, Eye drops, etc.

## Sample Data (Pilot Patient e4BwD8ZYDBccepXcJ.Ilo3w3)

### Route Examples from Real Data

| Route | Medication Example | Dosage Text Sample |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Oral** | Ondansetron | 7 mg, Oral, EVERY 8 HOURS PRN, Nausea |
| **Intravenous** | Ondansetron | 5.6 mg, Intravenous, ONCE, at 5.6 mL/hr, Administer over 15 Minutes |
| **Transdermal** | Scopolamine | 1.5 mg, Transdermal, ONCE, Apply patch behind ear |
| **Nasogastric** | Acetaminophen | 640 mg, Nasogastric, EVERY 4 HOURS PRN, Mild Pain |
| **Inhaled** | Tobramycin | 300 mg, Inhaled, ONCE |

**Key Observations**:
- Route values are **standardized** (Intravenous, Oral, not "IV", "PO")
- Route data is **comprehensive** across all medication types
- Route information is **critical for chemotherapy classification** (IV vs oral vs intrathecal)

## Integration into v_medications View

### Changes Made

**Enhanced CTE**:
```sql
medication_dosage_instructions AS (
    SELECT
        medication_request_id,
        -- Route information (CRITICAL for chemotherapy analysis)
        LISTAGG(DISTINCT dosage_instruction_route_text, ' | ')
            WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dosage_instruction_route_text) as route_text_aggregated,
        -- Method (e.g., IV push, IV drip)
        LISTAGG(DISTINCT dosage_instruction_method_text, ' | ')
            WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dosage_instruction_method_text) as method_text_aggregated,
        -- Full dosage instruction text
        LISTAGG(dosage_instruction_text, ' | ')
            WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dosage_instruction_sequence) as dosage_text_aggregated,
        -- Site (e.g., port, peripheral line)
        LISTAGG(DISTINCT dosage_instruction_site_text, ' | ')
            WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dosage_instruction_site_text) as site_text_aggregated,
        -- Patient instructions
        LISTAGG(DISTINCT dosage_instruction_patient_instruction, ' | ')
            WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dosage_instruction_patient_instruction) as patient_instruction_aggregated,
        -- Timing information
        LISTAGG(DISTINCT dosage_instruction_timing_code_text, ' | ')
            WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY dosage_instruction_timing_code_text) as timing_code_aggregated
    FROM fhir_prd_db.medication_request_dosage_instruction
    GROUP BY medication_request_id
)
```

**New Columns Added to SELECT**:
```sql
-- Dosage instruction fields (mrdi_ prefix) - CRITICAL FOR ROUTE ANALYSIS
mrdi.route_text_aggregated as mrdi_route_text,
mrdi.method_text_aggregated as mrdi_method_text,
mrdi.dosage_text_aggregated as mrdi_dosage_text,
mrdi.site_text_aggregated as mrdi_site_text,
mrdi.patient_instruction_aggregated as mrdi_patient_instruction,
mrdi.timing_code_aggregated as mrdi_timing_code,
```

**New JOIN**:
```sql
LEFT JOIN medication_dosage_instructions mrdi ON mr.id = mrdi.medication_request_id
```

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **All existing columns preserved** - No breaking changes
✅ **New columns use mrdi_ prefix** - Clear namespace separation
✅ **LISTAGG handles multiple routes** - If medication has multiple dosage instructions

## CBTN Data Dictionary Mapping

### Required Chemotherapy Route Field

**Field**: Not explicitly defined in CBTN data dictionary
**Inferred Need**: Route classification needed to distinguish:
- IV chemotherapy (most common)
- Oral chemotherapy (e.g., temozolomide)
- Intrathecal chemotherapy (CNS-directed)

### Use Cases for Route Data

1. **Chemotherapy Classification**
   - Filter to IV/oral/intrathecal routes only
   - Exclude topical, inhaled, eye drops (not chemotherapy)

2. **Treatment Intensity Assessment**
   - IV chemotherapy = inpatient/intensive
   - Oral chemotherapy = outpatient/maintenance

3. **CNS-Directed Therapy Identification**
   - Intrathecal route = CNS-directed therapy
   - Critical for brain tumor protocols

4. **Data Quality Validation**
   - Cross-validate route against medication type
   - E.g., bevacizumab must be IV, temozolomide must be oral

## Query Examples

### Get All Chemotherapy Routes for a Patient

```sql
SELECT
    patient_fhir_id,
    medication_name,
    mrdi_route_text,
    medication_start_date,
    mr_status
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_medications
WHERE patient_fhir_id = 'e4BwD8ZYDBccepXcJ.Ilo3w3'
    AND medication_name IN (
        -- Chemotherapy agents from ChemotherapyFilter
        'vinBLAStine', 'bevacizumab', 'selumetinib', 'temozolomide', ...
    )
ORDER BY medication_start_date;
```

### Count Chemotherapy by Route

```sql
SELECT
    mrdi_route_text,
    COUNT(*) as chemo_count
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_medications
WHERE medication_name IN (
    -- Chemotherapy agents
)
GROUP BY mrdi_route_text
ORDER BY chemo_count DESC;
```

### Identify Intrathecal Chemotherapy

```sql
SELECT
    patient_fhir_id,
    medication_name,
    medication_start_date,
    mrdi_dosage_text
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_medications
WHERE mrdi_route_text LIKE '%Intrathecal%'
    AND medication_name IN (
        'methotrexate', 'cytarabine', 'hydrocortisone'
    )
ORDER BY patient_fhir_id, medication_start_date;
```

## Gap Analysis Update

### ✅ RESOLVED: Chemotherapy Route

| Gap Item | Status | Resolution |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Chemotherapy administration route** | ✅ **RESOLVED** | `mrdi_route_text` added to v_medications view |
| Route data availability | ✅ **CONFIRMED** | 100% coverage in dosage_instruction_route_text |
| Route standardization | ✅ **CONFIRMED** | Values are standardized (Intravenous, Oral, etc.) |
| Integration with ChemotherapyFilter | ⏳ **PENDING** | Route filtering logic can be added to athena_query_agent.py |

### Remaining Gaps from STRUCTURED_DATA_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

**HYBRID Fields** (require clinical note extraction):
- ❌ **Chemotherapy line** (1st/2nd/3rd) - NOT AVAILABLE in structured data
- ❌ **Extent of resection** (GTR/STR/Biopsy) - NOT AVAILABLE in structured data
- ❌ **Specimen collection origin** (Initial/Recurrent) - PARTIAL (temporal only)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing - 30 minutes)
1. ✅ **v_medications view enhanced** - Route fields added
2. ⏳ **Deploy updated view** - Run CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW in Athena
3. ⏳ **Validate route data** - Test query on pilot patient
4. ⏳ **Update extraction scripts** - Modify athena_query_agent.py to use mrdi_route_text

### Short-Term (Route-Based Analysis - 1-2 hours)
5. ⏳ **Add route filtering to ChemotherapyFilter** - Filter by IV/oral/intrathecal
6. ⏳ **Create route-specific extraction methods** - Separate queries for systemic vs CNS-directed therapy
7. ⏳ **Validate route values for known chemotherapy agents** - Ensure bevacizumab=IV, temozolomide=oral, etc.

### Medium-Term (HYBRID Field Implementation - 1 week)
8. ⏳ **Implement chemotherapy line extraction** - HYBRID approach (temporal clustering + clinical notes)
9. ⏳ **Implement extent of resection extraction** - HYBRID approach (operative notes + imaging)
10. ⏳ **Implement specimen origin classification** - HYBRID approach (pathology reports)

## Conclusion

✅ **Medication route data is FULLY AVAILABLE and has been INTEGRATED into v_medications view**

**Data Quality**: 100% coverage, standardized values, comprehensive across all routes

**Integration**: Enhanced view includes 6 new dosage instruction fields (route, method, dosage text, site, patient instructions, timing)

**Impact**: Resolves critical gap for chemotherapy route classification in CBTN data dictionary mapping

**Status**: Ready for deployment and validation testing

**Files Modified**:
- `ATHENA_VIEW_CREATION_QUERIES.sql` - Enhanced v_medications view (lines 850-1015)

**Next Action**: Deploy updated v_medications view to Athena and validate with pilot patient extraction
