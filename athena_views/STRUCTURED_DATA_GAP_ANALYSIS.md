### Current Implementation

**✅ Fully Implemented:**
1. **ChemotherapyFilter** (`data_dictionary/chemotherapy_filter.py`)
   - Comprehensive agent keyword list
   - RxNorm code mapping
   - Filters v_medications to chemo agents only
   - Returns: medication_name, start_date, end_date, status

2. **AthenaQueryAgent.query_chemotherapy_medications()**
   - Uses ChemotherapyFilter
   - Returns filtered list of chemo agents
   - Date range filtering supported

3. **Radiation Query Methods:**
   - query_radiation_appointments()
   - query_radiation_treatment_courses()
   - query_radiation_prescriptions()
   - query_radiation_dose_tracking()
   - query_radiation_beam_configurations()
   - query_radiation_treatment_sites()

### Assessment: ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Chemotherapy agent identification (5 agent slots)
- ✅ Chemotherapy dates (start/stop)
- ✅ Radiation dates, doses, sites
- ✅ Filtering logic to isolate chemo from all medications

**Critical Gaps:**
1. ❌ **Chemotherapy line** (1st/2nd/3rd line) - NOT CAPTURED
   - Required for: treatment sequence analysis
   - Source: Would need temporal ordering + treatment intent from notes
   - Classification: HYBRID (dates from Athena + clinical intent from documents)

2. ✅ **Chemotherapy route** (IV/oral/intrathecal) - **RESOLVED** (October 18, 2025)
   - Required for: dosing analysis
   - Source: `medication_request_dosage_instruction.dosage_instruction_route_text`
   - Coverage: **100%** (788,060/788,060 dosage instructions)
   - Implementation: Added to v_medications as `mrdi_route_text` column
   - Classification: STRUCTURED_ONLY
   - Documentation: See MEDICATION_ROUTE_VERIFICATION.md

3. ❌ **Protocol enrollment status** - NOT CAPTURED
   - Required for: clinical trial tracking
   - Source: Treatment plans, consent forms
   - Classification: DOCUMENT_ONLY

4. ❌ **Treatment line sequencing** - NOT CAPTURED
   - Required for: progression analysis
   - Source: Temporal ordering + clinical notes (change reason)
   - Classification: HYBRID

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Add chemotherapy line detection** (HYBRID field)
   - Query all chemo medications with dates
   - Cluster by temporal gaps (>30 days = new line?)
   - Validate against clinical notes for "progression", "recurrence"

2. ~~**Add chemotherapy route extraction**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE**
   - Route data available via `mrdi_route_text` in v_medications
   - 100% coverage, standardized values (Intravenous, Oral, Intrathecal, etc.)
   - See MEDICATION_ROUTE_VERIFICATION.md for full details

3. **Add stem cell transplant CPT code check**
   - CPT: 38240, 38241, 38242, 38243
   - Add to v_procedures enhanced classification

---

## 3. SURGERY/PROCEDURES - ⚠️ PARTIAL (67% coverage)

### Required Fields (from CBTN Data Dictionary - 9 total)

| CBTN Field | Athena Source | Status | Coverage Details |
|------------|---------------|--------|------------------|
| **surgery** | v_procedures | ✅ COVERED | Can infer from is_tumor_surgery=true |
| **surgery_type** | v_procedures | ✅ COVERED | surgery_type field (craniotomy/spinal/endoscopic) |
| **surgery_type_other** | N/A | ❌ NOT COVERED | Free text override - DOCUMENT_ONLY |
| **extent_of_tumor_resection** | v_procedures + Documents | ⚠️ HYBRID | **CRITICAL FIELD** - needs operative notes |
| **specimen_to_cbtn** | N/A | ❌ NOT COVERED | Workflow field (CBTN shipping) - not clinical |
| **specimen_collection_origin** | v_procedures temporal | ⚠️ HYBRID | **CRITICAL FIELD** - 1st/2nd surgery classification |
| **date_specimen_collected** | v_procedures | ✅ COVERED | procedure_date (assuming same as surgery date) |
| **specimen_collection_date** | v_procedures | ✅ COVERED | procedure_date |
| **specimen_collection_standards** | N/A | ❌ NOT COVERED | Prospective vs retrospective - not in FHIR |

### Current Implementation - Enhanced v_procedures View

**✅ Just Completed (Version 2.0):**

1. **CPT-Based Classification** (90-95% precision)
   ```
   Tier 1: Definite Tumor (definite_tumor)
     - Craniotomy tumor resection: 61500-61548 (1,168 procedures)
     - Stereotactic procedures: 61750-61783 (1,493 procedures) ← Includes 61781 (MOST COMMON)
     - Neuroendoscopy tumor: 62164-62165 (69 procedures)
     - Skull base tumor: 61580-61607 (91 procedures)

   Tier 2: Tumor Support (tumor_support)
     - CSF management: 62201 (ETV) - 77.1% tumor overlap
     - Device implantation: 61210 (burr hole) - 81.2% tumor overlap

   Tier 3: Ambiguous (ambiguous)
     - Exploratory craniotomy: 61304-61305
   ```

2. **Sub-Schema Validation**
   - reason_code_text: Tumor indicators vs exclude indicators
   - body_site_text: Cranial sites vs peripheral sites
   - Confidence boosting: +5-15% for validated procedures

3. **Multi-Tier Confidence Scoring (0-100)**
   - 100%: CPT definite tumor + tumor reason + brain body site
   - 95%: CPT definite tumor + tumor reason OR brain body site
   - 90%: CPT definite tumor alone
   - 75-85%: Tumor support + validation
   - 0%: Force exclude (spasticity, trauma, shunt)

4. **New Classification Fields**
   - procedure_classification: Granular (e.g., 'craniotomy_tumor_resection')
   - cpt_type: Classification tier (definite_tumor/tumor_support/ambiguous)
   - surgery_type: High-level (craniotomy/stereotactic/neuroendoscopy/etc.)
   - is_tumor_surgery: Boolean
   - classification_confidence: 0-100 score
   - has_tumor_reason, has_tumor_body_site: Validation flags

### Procedure Sequencing for Initial/Recurrent Classification

**Current Capability:**
```sql
SELECT
    procedure_date,
    proc_code_text,
    cpt_code,
    cpt_classification,
    classification_confidence,
    validation_reason_code,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY patient_fhir_id
        ORDER BY procedure_date
    ) as surgery_sequence
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_procedures
WHERE patient_fhir_id = '{patient_id}'
    AND is_tumor_surgery = true
    AND cpt_type = 'definite_tumor'
ORDER BY procedure_date
```

**Mapping to CBTN specimen_collection_origin:**
```
Surgery #1 (first procedure_date) → specimen_collection_origin = 4 (Initial CNS Tumor Surgery)
Surgery #2+ → Requires clinical context to determine:
    - 5 (Repeat resection) - same tumor, recurrence
    - 6 (Second look surgery) - planned staged resection
    - 7 (Second malignancy surgery) - new tumor site
    - 11 (Progressive/recurrent tumor surgery) - confirmed progression
```

**Gap Identified:**
- ❌ **Cannot distinguish** between:
  - Repeat resection (#5) vs Second look (#6) vs Second malignancy (#7) vs Progressive/recurrent (#11)
  - **Requires:** Operative note analysis for surgeon intent, pathology comparison
  - **Classification:** HYBRID (dates from Athena + clinical context from documents)

### Assessment: ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Surgery identification (is_tumor_surgery with 90-95% precision)
- ✅ Surgery dates (procedure_date)
- ✅ Surgery type categorization (craniotomy/stereotactic/neuroendoscopy/etc.)
- ✅ Temporal sequencing (can identify 1st, 2nd, 3rd surgery)
- ✅ High confidence scoring (0-100 scale with sub-schema validation)

**Critical Gaps:**

1. ❌ **Extent of Resection** - NOT CAPTURED in structured data
   - Required values: GTR/Near total | Partial | Biopsy | Unavailable/Unknown
   - Source: Operative notes (surgeon assessment)
   - Classification: **HYBRID** (surgery date from Athena + GTR/STR/biopsy from op note)
   - **Priority: HIGH** - Core outcome measure

2. ❌ **Specimen Collection Origin (surgery intent classification)** - NOT CAPTURED
   - Cannot distinguish:
     - Initial surgery (#4)
     - Repeat resection (#5)
     - Second look (#6)
     - Second malignancy (#7)
     - Progressive/recurrent (#11)
   - Source: Operative notes + pathology comparison
   - Classification: **HYBRID** (dates + sequence from Athena + clinical intent from documents)
   - **Priority: HIGH** - Required for CBTN data submission

3. ⚠️ **Surgery Type Granularity** - PARTIAL
   - Current: surgery_type = 'craniotomy' (broad)
   - Required: Craniotomy | Spinal laminectomy | Endoscopic endonasal | Other
   - Source: CPT codes can provide this (61xxx = cranial, 63xxx = spinal, 62164 = endoscopic)
   - **Action:** Map CPT ranges to CBTN surgery_type dropdown
   - **Priority: MEDIUM** - Can derive from existing CPT classification

---

## Recommendations by Priority

### 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Implement Next)

**1. Extent of Resection (HYBRID)**
- **Field:** extent_of_tumor_resection
- **Required for:** Outcome analysis, CBTN submission
- **Implementation:**
  - Athena: v_procedures provides surgery dates, CPT codes
  - Documents: Operative notes extraction for "gross total", "subtotal", "biopsy"
  - Validation: Cross-check surgeon assessment vs imaging
- **Effort:** 4-6 hours (Medical Reasoning Agent + validation)

**2. Specimen Collection Origin (HYBRID)**
- **Field:** specimen_collection_origin
- **Required for:** CBTN data submission, recurrence analysis
- **Implementation:**
  - Athena: v_procedures temporal sequencing (1st, 2nd, 3rd surgery)
  - Documents: Operative notes for "recurrent", "progressive", "second primary"
  - Logic:
    - 1st surgery + pathology confirmed = Initial (#4)
    - 2nd+ surgery + "recurrence" in note = Repeat resection (#5)
    - 2nd+ surgery + "second look" = Second look (#6)
    - 2nd+ surgery + different site = Second malignancy (#7)
- **Effort:** 6-8 hours (temporal logic + document extraction + pathology linkage)

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY GAPS

**3. Chemotherapy Line (HYBRID)**
- **Field:** chemotherapy_line (not explicitly in CBTN but implied by temporal sequence)
- **Implementation:**
  - Athena: Temporal clustering of v_medications chemotherapy agents
  - Documents: "first-line", "second-line", "salvage" from treatment plans
  - Logic: Gap >30 days + new agents = new line
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours

**4. Chemotherapy Route (Check v_medications columns)**
- **Field:** chemotherapy_route
- **Action:** Query v_medications to check if mrr_route or mf_form populated
- **If not:** Extract from medication administration notes (HYBRID)
- **Effort:** 2-3 hours

**5. Surgery Type Granularity (Enhance CPT mapping)**
- **Field:** surgery_type (Craniotomy | Spinal laminectomy | Endoscopic endonasal)
- **Implementation:** Add mapping from CPT codes to CBTN dropdown values
  - 61xxx = Craniotomy
  - 63xxx = Spinal laminectomy
  - 62164/62165 = Endoscopic endonasal
- **Effort:** 1 hour (SQL enhancement)

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY / NOT ADDRESSABLE

**6. Workflow/Administrative Fields** (Not in clinical data)
- specimen_to_cbtn (shipping status)
- specimen_collection_standards (prospective/retrospective)
- treatment_which_visit (REDCap visit linkage)
- **Action:** Mark as NOT APPLICABLE for Athena extraction

**7. Free Text Fields** (DOCUMENT_ONLY)
- reason_for_treatment_change
- description_of_chemotherapy
- additional_radiation_description
- surgery_type_other
- **Action:** Defer to full document extraction pipeline

### Short-Term (This Week)
4. 🔲 **Implement extent_of_resection HYBRID extraction** - CRITICAL
5. 🔲 **Implement specimen_collection_origin HYBRID extraction** - CRITICAL
6. 🔲 **Add surgery_type CPT mapping** - enhance granularity
7. 🔲 **Implement chemotherapy_line detection** - temporal clustering

### Medium-Term (Next Week)
8. 🔲 **Test HYBRID extraction pipeline** - extent_of_resection on pilot patient
9. 🔲 **Validate surgery classification** - 10 patient sample
10. 🔲 **Document all gaps** - create tracking for DOCUMENT_ONLY fields

## Conclusion

**Demographics:** ✅ Fully addressed, no gaps
**Chemotherapy:** ⚠️ Agents identified, but sequencing/routing gaps
**Surgery:** ⚠️ Identification robust, but extent/intent classification requires HYBRID approach

**Overall Assessment:**
- Strong foundation for structured data extraction
- Enhanced v_procedures view significantly improves surgery identification
- **Two critical HYBRID fields needed:** extent_of_resection + specimen_collection_origin
- **Next priority:** Implement HYBRID field extraction workflow

**Recommendation:**
Proceed with **extent_of_resection** HYBRID extraction to validate end-to-end workflow before scaling.
