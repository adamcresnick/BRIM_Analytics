# RADIATION VIEWS - COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW & DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: ✅ **ALL FIXES DEPLOYED AND VALIDATED**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully completed deep review of all 5 radiation views, identified and fixed **4 critical bugs**, and deployed corrected views to AWS Athena production. All 913 radiation patients now have correctly structured data across all views.

---

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### Fix #1: v_radiation_summary - Patient ID Extraction (CRITICAL) ✅
**Location**: Line 5042
**Issue**: `SUBSTRING(subject_reference, 9)` was truncating patient IDs
**Impact**: 115 patients with radiation history flag had corrupted IDs
**Fix**: Changed to `subject_reference as patient_fhir_id`
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND VALIDATED

### Fix #2: v_radiation_documents - Content Selection (RECOMMENDED) ✅
**Location**: Lines 4351-4375
**Issue**: `MAX()` selects lexicographically largest attachment, not most recent
**Fix**: Replaced with `ROW_NUMBER()` ordered by `content_attachment_creation DESC`
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED

### Fix #3: v_radiation_treatments - Performance Optimization ✅
**Location**: Lines 255-261
**Issue**: Subquery scans entire tables on every view query
**Fix**: Moved to `WITH radiation_patients_list AS` CTE
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED

### Fix #4: v_radiation_treatment_appointments - Schema Errors (CRITICAL) ✅
**Location**: Multiple lines
**Issues Found**:
1. Column `service_type_coding_display` doesn't exist (should be `service_type_text`)
2. Type mismatch: comparing VARCHAR `a.start` with TIMESTAMP(3) dates
3. ORDER BY `a.start` not in SELECT (should be `appointment_start`)

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Changed `service_type_coding_display` → `service_type_text` (lines 4510, 4512-4514, 4559)
2. Added `TRY(CAST(a.start AS TIMESTAMP(3)))` for date comparisons (lines 4596-4597, 4602-4603)
3. Changed ORDER BY to use `appointment_start` alias (line 4608)

**Status**: ✅ ALL DEPLOYED

## VALIDATION RESULTS

### Patient Count Analysis:
```
TOTAL RADIATION PATIENTS: 913 (previously showed 1,377 due to ID corruption)

Breakdown by Source:
├─ Documents:                 684 patients (74.9%)
├─ Care Plans:                568 patients (62.2%)
├─ Radiation Flag:            115 patients (12.6%)
├─ Structured (Observation):   90 patients  (9.9%)
├─ Service Requests:            1 patient   (0.1%)
└─ Appointments:                0 patients  (0.0%)
```

### Patient ID Length Analysis:
```
Min Length: 24 characters
Max Length: 45 characters
Avg Length: 43.54 characters

✅ VERIFIED: Patient IDs are NOT truncated
✅ VERIFIED: Variable lengths are NORMAL (different patients have different ID formats)
```

### Data Quality Scores:
```
Patients with 3+ data sources:     62 patients  (6.8%)  - Highest quality
Patients with 2 data sources:     315 patients (34.5%)  - Good quality
Patients with 1 data source:      421 patients (46.1%)  - Limited data
Patients with radiation flag only: 115 patients (12.6%)  - Minimal data
```

## SCHEMA VALIDATION FINDINGS

### Issues Discovered During Review:

1. **appointment_service_type Table**:
   - ❌ Does NOT have `service_type_coding_display` column
   - ✅ HAS `service_type_text` and `service_type_coding` columns
   - **Lesson**: Always verify subschema tables, not just main tables

2. **appointment Table**:
   - ✅ `start` column is VARCHAR, not TIMESTAMP
   - ✅ Requires `TRY(CAST(...))` when comparing to TIMESTAMP columns
   - **Lesson**: Check data types for all comparison operations

3. **observation Table**:
   - ✅ `subject_reference` does NOT have "Patient/" prefix
   - ✅ IDs are bare format: `e-RTlNNtrnYfazO7K4JGWzQUSogJpql1w3CHWg1pCsnk3`
   - **Lesson**: Never assume FHIR reference format without checking

## EXTRACTION STRATEGY DISTRIBUTION

```
Strategy                                    Patients   Percentage
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
metadata_only_limited_extraction              421       46.1%
document_based_high_priority                  493       54.0%
structured_primary_with_document_validation    87        9.5%
structured_only_no_validation                   3        0.3%

Note: Some patients appear in multiple categories
```

## KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Always Check Subschemas
- Main tables may not have all the columns
- Subschema tables (e.g., `appointment_service_type`) have different structures
- **Action**: Added comprehensive schema validation to review process

### 2. Verify Data Types in Comparisons
- VARCHAR datetime columns can't be directly compared to TIMESTAMP
- Always use `TRY(CAST(...))` for safe conversion
- **Action**: Added data type checking to all WHERE clauses

### 3. Sync Individual and Master Files
- Individual SQL files can drift from master DATETIME_STANDARDIZED_VIEWS.sql
- **Action**: Created extraction script to ensure sync

### 4. Test ORDER BY Clauses
- `SELECT DISTINCT` requires ORDER BY columns to be in SELECT list
- **Action**: Use aliases from SELECT list in ORDER BY
