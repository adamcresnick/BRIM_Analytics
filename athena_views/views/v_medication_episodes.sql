-- VIEW: v_medication_episodes
-- PURPOSE: Group individual medication administrations into treatment episodes
-- DATE: 2025-10-28
--
-- APPROACH: Temporal windowing (gap-based episode detection)
-- - Gap > 21 days between same medication â†’ new episode
-- - Groups by patient + medication name
-- - Provides episode-level spans for layered timeline visualization
--
-- USE CASE: Layered timeline showing treatment episode spans overlaying
--           individual medication administration events
