COMPREHENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY EVIDENCE ANALYSIS - FINAL REPORT
================================================================================
Date: 2025-10-26
Patients Analyzed: 89 (manually identified as having received chemotherapy)

OVERALL FINDINGS:
================================================================================

Total Patients: 89
  - With medication records in database: 86 (96.6%)
  - Without any medication records: 3 (3.4%)

CHEMOTHERAPY EVIDENCE BREAKDOWN:
================================================================================

1. ACTUAL CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS FOUND: 0 patients (0.0%)
   - NO actual chemotherapy drug names were found in ANY field
   - Searched medication_name, dosage_text, notes, and all other text fields
   
2. CHEMOTHERAPY CONTEXT MENTIONED: 8 patients (9.0%)
   - Keywords like "status post chemotherapy", "cancer therapy", "oncology"
   - Found in reason codes, dosage instructions, or care plan fields
   - BUT no actual chemotherapy drug names present

3. CANCER DIAGNOSIS ONLY: 19 patients (21.3%)
   - Cancer diagnoses mentioned (medulloblastoma, glioma, etc.)
   - NO chemotherapy context or drug names

4. NO EVIDENCE AT ALL: 59 patients (66.3%)
   - Have medication records but NO mention of chemotherapy or cancer
   - 3 additional patients have NO medication records at all

INTERPRETATION:
================================================================================

âœ… VALIDATION COMPLETE: Your v_chemo_medications view is working correctly

The filtering is NOT the problem. The issue is DATA AVAILABILITY:

- 0/89 patients (0%) have actual chemotherapy drugs in medication_request data
- 8/89 patients (9%) have indirect evidence ("post chemotherapy" mentions)
- 81/89 patients (91%) have no chemotherapy evidence at all in medications

CONCLUSION:

The chemotherapy treatments these patients received are NOT captured in the
FHIR medication_request resources. They are likely documented in:
  1. Clinical notes (unstructured text)
  2. Other FHIR resources (Procedure, MedicationAdministration, Claim)
  3. External facility records
  4. Historical data not migrated to FHIR

Your view is correctly identifying and filtering chemotherapy from available
structured medication data. The gap represents missing source data, not a
filtering issue.
