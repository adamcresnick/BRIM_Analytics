## Example Queries

### 1. Get All Episodes for a Patient

```sql
SELECT
    episode_id,
    episode_detection_method,
    episode_start_date,
    episode_end_date,
    episode_duration_days,
    total_dose_cgy,
    radiation_fields,
    num_documents,
    nlp_extraction_priority
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_radiation_treatment_episodes
WHERE patient_fhir_id = 'Patient/123'
ORDER BY episode_start_date;
```

### 2. Get High-Quality Episodes for Analysis

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_radiation_episode_enrichment
WHERE data_completeness_tier IN ('COMPLETE', 'GOOD')
  AND enrichment_score >= 50
ORDER BY patient_fhir_id, episode_start_date;
```

### 3. Find Episodes with Low Appointment Fulfillment

```sql
SELECT
    patient_fhir_id,
    episode_id,
    episode_start_date,
    total_appointments,
    fulfilled_appointments,
    appointment_fulfillment_rate_pct
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_radiation_episode_enrichment
WHERE appointment_fulfillment_rate_pct < 80
  AND total_appointments > 0
ORDER BY appointment_fulfillment_rate_pct;
```

### 4. Identify Re-irradiation Patients

```sql
SELECT
    patient_fhir_id,
    COUNT(*) as num_episodes,
    MIN(episode_start_date) as first_episode,
    MAX(episode_start_date) as latest_episode,
    AVG(enrichment_score) as avg_enrichment
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_radiation_episode_enrichment
GROUP BY patient_fhir_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY num_episodes DESC;
```

### 5. Get High-Priority Documents for NLP

```sql
SELECT
    patient_fhir_id,
    episode_id,
    episode_start_date,
    num_documents,
    priority_1_docs,
    priority_2_docs,
    highest_priority_available,
    constituent_document_ids
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_radiation_treatment_episodes
WHERE episode_detection_method = 'document_temporal_cluster'
  AND highest_priority_available IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY highest_priority_available, episode_start_date;
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Strategy D Episode Duration

**Issue:** Average 11.4 days (vs 159 for Strategy A)
**Cause:** Document clustering creates brief episodes around documentation periods
**Impact:** Fewer during-treatment appointments linked (0.8 vs 6.3 avg)
**Implication:** Strategy D enrichment focuses on consultation-only appointments (28.8%)

### 2. Care Plan Date Sparsity

**Issue:** Only 10 care plans have dates (out of thousands)
**Impact:** Care plan linkage relies on patient-level fallback
**Mitigation:** Use care plan data for protocol tracking, not temporal precision

### 3. Appointment Linkage Window

**Window:** ±1 year for appointment-to-episode linking
**Trade-off:** May link unrelated appointments for patients with multiple close episodes
**Recommendation:** Use `appointment_phase` to filter to relevant timeframes

### 4. High Care Plan Counts

**Observation:** Avg 34.1 care plans per episode
**Cause:** Fallback logic links all patient care plans when dates unavailable
**Benefit:** Comprehensive protocol tracking
**Caution:** Not all linked care plans temporally relevant

---

## Performance Considerations

### View Execution Times

- `v_radiation_treatment_episodes`: ~15-20 seconds (complex CTEs, document clustering)
- `v_radiation_episode_enrichment`: ~20-25 seconds (adds appointment/care plan joins)

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Materialized Tables:** Consider materializing episode base for faster enrichment joins
2. **Partitioning:** Partition by episode_start_date for temporal queries
3. **Index Hints:** Patient_fhir_id and episode_id are primary join keys

---

## Data Quality Monitoring

### Recommended Checks

1. **Episode Count Stability**
   - Monitor total episode count (expected: ~967)
   - Alert if count drops >5%

2. **Enrichment Coverage**
   - Monitor appointment enrichment rate (expected: ~63%)
   - Monitor care plan enrichment rate (expected: ~62%)
   - Alert if rates drop >10%

3. **Fulfillment Rate**
   - Monitor average appointment fulfillment (expected: ~96%)
   - Alert if drops <90%

4. **Data Completeness**
   - Monitor GOOD/COMPLETE tier percentage (expected: ~47%)
   - Alert if drops below 40%
