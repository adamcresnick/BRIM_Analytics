## Appointment Enrichment Analysis

### Overall Appointment Metrics

| Metric | Strategy A | Strategy D | Overall |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Avg Appointments per Episode** | 7.7 | 3.2 | 5.5 |
| **Appointment Fulfillment Rate** | 96.4% | 95.8% | 96.1% |
| **Episodes with Appointments** | 75/95 (78.9%) | 531/872 (60.9%) | 606/967 (62.7%) |

**Key Finding:** Strategy A episodes have 2.4x more appointments per episode than Strategy D (7.7 vs 3.2), likely because:
- Strategy A has longer episode durations (159 days vs 11 days)
- Strategy A represents complete treatment courses with full appointment history
- Strategy D episodes cluster around brief document periods

### Appointment Phase Distribution

| Phase | Strategy A (avg) | Strategy D (avg) | Overall (avg) | Description |
|-------|------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Pre-treatment** | 1.0 | 0.8 | 0.9 | Appointments ≤30 days before episode start |
| **During Treatment** | 6.3 | 0.8 | 3.6 | Appointments during episode dates |
| **Post-treatment** | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.3 | Appointments ≤30 days after episode end |
| **Early Follow-up** | 0.1 | 0.5 | 0.3 | Appointments 31-90 days post-episode |

**Key Insight:** Strategy A episodes have 7.9x more during-treatment appointments (6.3 vs 0.8), confirming:
- Strategy A captures full treatment courses with regular clinic visits
- Strategy D brief durations (11 days) miss most treatment appointments
- During-treatment phase most valuable for linking appointments to episodes

### Treatment Phase Coverage

| Coverage Level | Description | Strategy A | Strategy D | Total |
|----------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|
| **FULL_CONTINUUM** | Pre + During + Post appointments | 1 (1.1%) | 36 (4.1%) | 37 (3.8%) |
| **TREATMENT_PLUS_ONE** | During + (Pre OR Post) | 58 (61.1%) | 112 (12.8%) | 170 (17.6%) |
| **TREATMENT_ONLY** | During appointments only | 10 (10.5%) | 66 (7.6%) | 76 (7.9%) |
| **CONSULTATION_ONLY** | Pre or Post only (no during) | 6 (6.3%) | 251 (28.8%) | 257 (26.6%) |
| **NO_APPOINTMENTS** | No linked appointments | 20 (21.1%) | 407 (46.7%) | 427 (44.2%) |

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- **62.2% of Strategy A episodes** have treatment + pre/post coverage (excellent continuum)
- **20.5% of Strategy D episodes** have treatment-phase appointments (modest coverage)
- **44.2% of all episodes** have no appointment linkage (may be external treatment or data gaps)

## Care Plan Enrichment Analysis

### Care Plan Coverage

| Metric | Strategy A | Strategy D | Overall |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Episodes with Care Plans** | 65/95 (68.4%) | 533/872 (61.1%) | 598/967 (61.8%) |
| **Avg Care Plans per Episode** | 35.6 | 32.5 | 34.1 |
| **Care Plans with Dates** | 4 total | 6 total | 10 total |

**Key Finding:** High care plan counts (avg 34.1 per episode) suggest:
- Broad linkage due to sparse date availability (only 10 care plans have dates)
- Fallback logic links all patient care plans when dates unavailable
- Care plan metadata more useful for protocol tracking than temporal boundaries

### Care Plan Intent Classification

Across all 967 episodes:
- Intent = 'plan': Majority of care plans
- Intent = 'proposal': Proposed treatment plans
- Intent = 'order': Active treatment orders
- *(Detailed counts available in raw care plan linkage data)*

### Care Plan Status

- **Active care plans:** Present across both strategies
- **Completed care plans:** Indicator of finished treatment courses
- **Draft care plans:** Treatment planning phase
- *(Detailed counts available in raw care plan linkage data)*

## Data Completeness Tiers

The enrichment layer assigns a 4-tier completeness classification:

| Tier | Definition | Strategy A | Strategy D | Total | % of Episodes |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|-------|---------------|
| **COMPLETE** | Has structured dose + appointments + care plans | 58 | 0 | 58 | 6.0% |
| **GOOD** | Has structured dose OR (appointments + care plans) | 37 | 364 | 401 | 41.5% |
| **PARTIAL** | Has appointments OR care plans OR documents | 0 | 508 | 508 | 52.5% |
| **MINIMAL** | Sparse data across all sources | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% |

**Interpretation:**
- **47.5% episodes have GOOD or COMPLETE data** (459/967) - suitable for primary analysis
- **52.5% episodes have PARTIAL data** (508/967) - useful for descriptive statistics
- **0% episodes have MINIMAL data** - All episodes have at least one enrichment source

---

## Enrichment Score Distribution

**Enrichment Score** is a 0-100 composite metric based on:
- Base episode data (40 points): Structured dose (20) + Documents (20)
- Appointment enrichment (30 points): Any appointments (10) + During-treatment (10) + ≥80% fulfillment (10)
- Care plan enrichment (30 points): Any care plans (10) + Dated care plans (10) + Active care plans (10)

| Strategy | Avg Score | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Strategy A** | 56.4 | Good enrichment (structured data + appointments + care plans) |
| **Strategy D** | 45.7 | Moderate enrichment (documents + some appointments/care plans) |
| **Overall** | 51.1 | Above-average enrichment across all episodes |

**Score Breakdown:**
- **60-100 (Excellent):** 58 episodes (6.0%) - Strategy A with full continuum
- **40-59 (Good):** 401 episodes (41.5%) - Mixed sources with moderate coverage
- **20-39 (Fair):** 508 episodes (52.5%) - Partial enrichment
- **0-19 (Poor):** 0 episodes (0%) - None present

## Technical Implementation

### View Architecture

**File:** [V_RADIATION_EPISODE_ENRICHMENT.sql](file:///Users/resnick/Documents/GitHub/RADIANT_PCA/BRIM_Analytics/athena_views/views/testing/V_RADIATION_EPISODE_ENRICHMENT.sql)

**Structure:**
1. **Episode Base** (lines 17-34): Import from v_radiation_treatment_episodes
2. **Appointment Enrichment** (lines 42-146)
   - Link appointments via v_appointments (100% date coverage)
   - Temporal classification (±1 year window)
   - Phase assignment (5 categories)
   - Aggregation by episode
3. **Care Plan Enrichment** (lines 157-224)
   - Link care plans via temporal overlap or patient fallback
   - Intent/status classification
   - Hierarchical structure tracking
4. **Combined Enrichment** (lines 231-279)
   - LEFT JOIN preserves all episodes
   - COALESCE defaults to 0 for missing data
5. **Derived Metrics** (lines 287-323)
   - Enrichment score calculation
   - Data completeness tier assignment
   - Treatment phase coverage classification

### Key Technical Patterns

**Temporal Phase Classification:**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN appointment_date < episode_start_date
        AND DATE_DIFF('day', appointment_date, episode_start_date) <= 30
        THEN 'pre_treatment'
    WHEN appointment_date BETWEEN episode_start_date AND episode_end_date
        THEN 'during_treatment'
    WHEN appointment_date > episode_end_date
        AND DATE_DIFF('day', episode_end_date, appointment_date) <= 30
        THEN 'post_treatment'
    WHEN appointment_date > episode_end_date
        AND DATE_DIFF('day', episode_end_date, appointment_date) <= 90
        THEN 'early_followup'
    WHEN appointment_date > episode_end_date
        AND DATE_DIFF('day', episode_end_date, appointment_date) <= 365
        THEN 'late_followup'
    ELSE 'unrelated'
END as appointment_phase
```

**Care Plan Linkage Logic:**
```sql
WHERE
    -- Option 1: Temporal overlap (13 care plans with dates)
    (cp.cp_period_start IS NOT NULL
     AND cp.cp_period_end IS NOT NULL
     AND CAST(cp.cp_period_start AS DATE) <= eb.episode_end_date
     AND CAST(cp.cp_period_end AS DATE) >= eb.episode_start_date)
    OR
    -- Option 2: Fallback - all care plans if no dates
    (cp.cp_period_start IS NULL OR cp.cp_period_end IS NULL)
```

**Enrichment Score Formula:**
```sql
CASE WHEN has_structured_dose THEN 20 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN has_documents THEN 20 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN total_appointments > 0 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN during_treatment_appointments > 0 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN appointment_fulfillment_rate_pct >= 80 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN total_care_plans > 0 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN care_plans_with_dates > 0 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END +
CASE WHEN care_plans_active > 0 THEN 10 ELSE 0 END
```

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Care Plan Date Sparsity

**Issue:** Only 10 care plans (out of thousands) have dates
**Impact:** Care plan linkage relies on patient-level fallback, not temporal precision
**Mitigation:** Use care plan data for protocol tracking, not temporal boundaries

### 2. Strategy D Episode Duration

**Issue:** Strategy D episodes average 11 days (vs 159 for Strategy A)
**Impact:** Fewer during-treatment appointments linked (0.8 vs 6.3 avg)
**Explanation:** Document clustering creates brief episodes around documentation periods
**Implication:** Strategy D enrichment focuses on consultation-only appointments (28.8%)

### 3. Appointment Linkage Window

**Decision:** ±1 year window for appointment-to-episode linking
**Rationale:** Captures pre-planning and long-term follow-up
**Trade-off:** May link unrelated appointments for patients with multiple close episodes
**Recommendation:** Use appointment_phase to filter to relevant timeframes

### 4. High Care Plan Counts

**Observation:** Avg 34.1 care plans per episode
**Cause:** Fallback logic links all patient care plans when dates unavailable
**Benefit:** Comprehensive protocol tracking
**Caution:** Not all linked care plans temporally relevant to specific episode

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Episode Sequencing (High Priority)

**Goal:** Add re-irradiation detection and episode ordering
**Features:**
- Episode number: "Episode 1 of 3" for patient
- Inter-episode gap analysis
- Initial vs. salvage treatment classification
- Temporal relationship to chemotherapy episodes

### 2. Timeline View (High Priority)

**Goal:** Create comprehensive v_radiation_course_timeline
**Components:**
- Episodes (base layer from enrichment view)
- Appointments (classified by phase)
- Documents (linked to episodes via date proximity)
- Treatments (daily fractions if available)
- Care plans (protocol tracking)

**Value:** Single denormalized view for temporal radiation treatment analysis

### 3. Multi-Modality Integration

**Goal:** Link radiation episodes to chemotherapy and surgery episodes
**Use Case:** Multi-modality treatment sequence analysis
**Pattern:** Similar enrichment approach using temporal windows

### 4. NLP Validation

**Goal:** Extract dose/site from documents and compare to structured data
**Cohort:** Strategy A episodes (have both structured data and documents)
**Purpose:** Validate NLP extraction accuracy using gold standard
**Next:** Apply validated NLP to Strategy D episodes to backfill missing structured data

### 5. Production Deployment

**Tasks:**
- Move from `/testing/` to `/views/` directory
- Add comprehensive inline documentation
- Create example queries for common use cases
- Update README with enrichment layer architecture
- Add to monitoring/alerting for data quality
