## Documentation by Role

### For Analysts
**"I want to understand what these OIDs mean"**

1. Look up OIDs in production:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM fhir_prd_db.v_oid_reference
   WHERE masterfile_code = 'CPT';
   ```

2. See decoded OIDs in views:
   ```sql
   SELECT pcc_coding_system_code, pcc_coding_system_name
   FROM fhir_prd_db.v_procedures_tumor;
   ```

**Read:** [OID_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](OID_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

### For Developers
**"I need to add OID decoding to a new view"**

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Discover what OIDs are used (queries in guide)
2. Add missing OIDs to v_oid_reference
3. Add 3 decoded columns to your view
4. Validate 100% coverage

**Read:** [OID_DECODING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](OID_DECODING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

### For Project Managers
**"What did we build and what's the impact?"**

- **22 OIDs documented** (9 Epic + 13 Standard)
- **100% coverage** of production procedure OIDs
- **1 view enhanced** (v_procedures_tumor) - proof of concept
- **Complete workflow** documented for team

**Read:** [OID_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](OID_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)

### For Data Governance
**"How do we validate and maintain OID documentation?"**

- Automated discovery queries
- Monthly validation process
- Self-correcting via production data
- Version controlled in Git

**Read:** [OID_VALIDATION_REPORT.md](OID_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)

## Key Concepts

### What is an OID?
**Object Identifier** - Globally unique identifier for coding systems

**Examples:**
- `http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt` = CPT codes (standard)
- `urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.20.2.7.2.696580` = EAP (Epic procedure masterfile)

### Why Decode OIDs?

**Before (Hard to Read):**
```sql
WHERE code_coding_system = 'urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.20.2.7.2.696580'
```

**After (Self-Documenting):**
```sql
WHERE pcc_coding_system_code = 'EAP'  -- Epic Procedure Masterfile
```

### Epic OID Structure

```
urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.20.2.7.2.696580
                         ‚îÇ      ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ ASCII: E(69) A(65) P(80) = EAP
                         ‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ Type: 2 = masterfile
                         ‚îî‚îÄ Site: 20 = CHOP
```

## Common Tasks

### Task: Look up an OID

```sql
SELECT * FROM fhir_prd_db.v_oid_reference
WHERE oid_uri = 'your_oid_here';
```

### Task: Find all Epic OIDs

```sql
SELECT * FROM fhir_prd_db.v_oid_reference
WHERE oid_source = 'Epic';
```

### Task: Discover new OIDs in production

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT code_coding_system, COUNT(*)
FROM fhir_prd_db.procedure_code_coding
WHERE code_coding_system IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY code_coding_system;
```

### Task: Validate OID coverage in a view

```sql
SELECT code_coding_system
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_procedures_tumor
WHERE code_coding_system IS NOT NULL
  AND pcc_coding_system_code IS NULL;  -- Should be empty!
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to update views when I add OIDs to v_oid_reference?
**A:** No! Views LEFT JOIN to v_oid_reference dynamically. Just redeploy v_oid_reference.

### Q: How do I decode an Epic OID?
**A:** Extract the 6-digit ASCII code and convert to letters:
- 696580 ‚Üí 69,65,80 ‚Üí E,A,P = **EAP**

See ASCII table in [OID_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](OID_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

### Q: What if I find an OID not in v_oid_reference?
**A:**
1. Add it to `v_oid_reference.sql`
2. Redeploy v_oid_reference
3. Views update automatically

See workflow in [OID_DECODING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](OID_DECODING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

### Q: How accurate is the OID documentation?
**A:** **100%** for procedure_code_coding (validated against production)

See [OID_VALIDATION_REPORT.md](OID_VALIDATION_REPORT.md) for details.

### Q: Can I extend this to other FHIR resources?
**A:** Yes! The pattern works for:
- Medications (medication_request_code_coding)
- Diagnoses (condition_code_coding)
- Labs (observation_code_coding)
- All FHIR resources with code_coding_system

See view-specific patterns in [OID_DECODING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](OID_DECODING_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)
