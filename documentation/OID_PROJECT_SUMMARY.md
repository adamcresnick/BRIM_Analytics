### Before & After

**Before:**
```sql
WHERE code_coding_system = 'urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.20.2.7.2.696580'
-- ❓ What is this?
```

**After:**
```sql
WHERE pcc_coding_system_code = 'EAP'  -- Epic Procedure Masterfile
-- ✅ Clear and self-documenting
```

---

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (60% Accurate)
1. Reviewed codebase for existing OIDs
2. Studied Epic documentation
3. Used your analyst's ASCII decoding notes
4. Created v_oid_reference with educated guesses
5. Documented 3/5 production OIDs (missed CDT-2, HCPCS)

**Result:** 98.2% coverage by procedure volume, but incomplete

### Phase 2: Validation & Correction (100% Accurate)
1. **Self-validated** against production data
2. Found 2 missing OIDs via discovery queries
3. Researched at oid-base.com
4. Added CDT-2 and HCPCS to v_oid_reference
5. Re-validated to confirm 100% coverage

**Result:** Complete documentation, honest assessment

### Phase 3: Documentation & Process
1. Created comprehensive workflow guide
2. Built validation framework
3. Documented best practices
4. Created quick reference cheat sheet

**Result:** Reusable process for entire team

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Starting with real code**
   - Found actual OIDs in your SQL views
   - Based implementation on real usage patterns

2. **Using your analyst's notes**
   - ASCII decoding pattern was invaluable
   - CHOP site code (20) was correct

3. **Self-validation**
   - Caught my own mistakes
   - Fixed before anyone else noticed
   - Built confidence in the framework

4. **Comprehensive documentation**
   - Team can now extend to other views
   - Clear process, not just code

### What Could Be Better 🔄

1. **Should have validated first**
   - Discovered production OIDs BEFORE documenting
   - Would have caught CDT-2/HCPCS immediately

2. **Over-documented Epic masterfiles**
   - Added ORD, ERX, CSN, DEP, SER
   - Only EAP is used in procedure_code_coding
   - Others may be in medication/encounter tables

3. **Assumptions about specialty codes**
   - Didn't expect dental (CDT-2) in neurosurgery
   - Didn't anticipate HCPCS codes

**Key Takeaway:** Always validate against production data first!

## Usage Examples

### For Analysts

```sql
-- Find all Epic vs Standard coding
SELECT
    pcc_coding_system_source,
    COUNT(*) as procedure_count
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_procedures_tumor
GROUP BY pcc_coding_system_source;

-- Filter to specific coding system
SELECT * FROM fhir_prd_db.v_procedures_tumor
WHERE pcc_coding_system_code = 'CPT';

-- Look up an unknown OID
SELECT * FROM fhir_prd_db.v_oid_reference
WHERE oid_uri = 'urn:oid:1.2.840.114350.1.13.20.2.7.2.696580';
```

### For Developers

```sql
-- Discover new OIDs in production
SELECT DISTINCT code_coding_system, COUNT(*)
FROM fhir_prd_db.procedure_code_coding
WHERE code_coding_system IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY code_coding_system
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Validate OID coverage
SELECT code_coding_system
FROM fhir_prd_db.v_procedures_tumor
WHERE code_coding_system IS NOT NULL
  AND pcc_coding_system_code IS NULL;  -- Should be empty
```
