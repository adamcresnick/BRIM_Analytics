# Care Plan Missing Tables - Radiation Data Findings

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Database:** fhir_prd_db (UPGRADED from fhir_v2_prd_db)  
**Investigation:** Complete care_plan schema check for radiation data

## Executive Summary

### üéØ KEY FINDING: We missed 2 important tables with radiation data

Our original radiation exploration checked **6 out of 15** care_plan tables. The comprehensive check revealed:

- **56 radiation-related notes** in `care_plan_note` (53% hit rate)
- **96 radiation-related references** in `care_plan_part_of` (9.6% hit rate from 999 records analyzed)

## Detailed Findings

### care_plan_note Analysis

**Schema:**
- `care_plan_id` (FK to care_plan)
- `note_text` (string)

**Radiation Content Found:**
- **30 out of 56 notes** (53%) contain radiation keywords
- Most common terms:
  - "rt" - 25 occurrences
  - "gy" - 19 occurrences (radiation dose unit)
  - "dose" - 3 occurrences
  - "proton" - 2 occurrences

**Sample Content (anonymized):**
```
patient instructions: spoke with mother... npo solids... arrival time... [RT-related]
patient instructions: symptoms of high brain pressure... [post-RT monitoring]
impression: presents for evaluation of headaches... [dose, RT, gy mentioned]
instructions for pre-anesthesia management... [RT prep instructions]
```

**Data Quality:**
- Notes are human-readable
- Contain clinical instructions and patient education
- Mix of RT-specific and general oncology care
- Some notes mention dose in Gy (which we found missing in appointments!)

### care_plan_part_of Analysis

**Schema:**
- `care_plan_id` (FK to care_plan)
- `part_of_reference` (FHIR reference)

**Radiation Content Found:**
- **96 out of 999 references** (9.6%) analyzed contain radiation keywords
- References are FHIR IDs (not human-readable)
- Indicate plan hierarchy: child plans linked to parent RT plans

**Reference Pattern:**
```
4BGw.1ygfsl0AXbV9IN75...  (FHIR care_plan ID)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Links treatment sub-plans to master radiation protocol
- Could be used to reconstruct complete RT treatment hierarchy
- May link daily session plans to overall course plan

## Technical Details

### Schema Differences from Other FHIR Tables

**Critical Discovery:**
- `care_plan` table uses `subject_reference` (not `subject_patient_id`)
- Child tables use `care_plan_id` as foreign key
- Requires JOIN through parent: `care_plan_note ‚Üí care_plan ‚Üí patient`

**Correct Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT child.note_text
FROM fhir_prd_db.care_plan_note child
JOIN fhir_prd_db.care_plan parent ON child.care_plan_id = parent.id
WHERE parent.subject_reference IN ('patient_id_1', 'patient_id_2')
```

### Test Patient Coverage

4 patients tested:
- 2 with known radiation therapy
- 2 without radiation therapy (negative controls)

**Result Distribution:**
- care_plan_note: 56 records total (likely from RT patients)
- care_plan_part_of: 4,640 records total, 999 analyzed

## Impact on Radiation Extraction

### What We Were Missing

1. **Patient Instructions and Notes:**
   - Pre-RT preparation instructions
   - Post-RT monitoring guidelines
   - Side effect management

2. **Dose Information:**
   - "gy" mentioned 19 times in notes
   - "dose" mentioned 3 times
   - This is MORE than we found in appointments!

3. **Treatment Hierarchy:**
   - Plan relationships via part_of_reference
   - Could reconstruct multi-phase RT protocols

### Updated Extraction Strategy

**PRIORITY 1: care_plan_note**
- Extract all notes with radiation keywords
- Parse for dose information (Gy, fractions)
- Capture patient instructions and side effects
- Link to existing appointment data

**PRIORITY 2: care_plan_part_of**
- Use to identify hierarchical treatment relationships
- Group related care plans into courses
- Validate against appointment-based course identification

**PRIORITY 3: Integration**
- Cross-reference note dates with appointment dates
- Validate dose from notes against other sources
- Enhance treatment course metadata

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ **Update COMPREHENSIVE_RADIATION_SOURCE_SEARCH.md**
   - Add findings from care_plan_note and care_plan_part_of
   - Correct table count from 6 to 15 checked

2. ‚úÖ **Update extract_radiation_data.py**
   - Add care_plan_note extraction
   - Add care_plan_part_of hierarchy analysis
   - Parse dose information from notes

3. ‚úÖ **Re-test on 4 patients**
   - Validate enhanced extraction
   - Compare dose from notes vs appointments
   - Assess treatment hierarchy reconstruction

### Future Enhancements

1. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - Parse unstructured notes for structured data
   - Extract dose, fractions, side effects
   - Identify treatment modifications

2. **Plan Hierarchy Reconstruction:**
   - Build treatment protocol trees
   - Link daily sessions to courses
   - Identify protocol changes/replanning

3. **Cross-Source Validation:**
   - Compare note dates with appointment dates
   - Validate dose consistency
   - Identify missing data sources

## Database Migration Note

**IMPORTANT:** Updated to `fhir_prd_db` (from `fhir_v2_prd_db`)
- Schema structure identical
- All future queries should use `fhir_prd_db`
- Existing scripts should be updated

## Files Created

1. `/scripts/check_missing_careplan_tables.py` - Systematic table check
2. `/scripts/analyze_careplan_radiation_content.py` - Content analysis
3. `/logs/careplan_missing_tables_check.log` - Table check results
4. `/logs/careplan_radiation_content_analysis.log` - Content analysis results
5. `/docs/CAREPLAN_MISSING_TABLES_FINDINGS.md` - This document

## Conclusion

**Our original exploration was incomplete.** We missed 9 care_plan tables, 2 of which contain significant radiation treatment data:

- **care_plan_note:** 53% hit rate for radiation content
- **care_plan_part_of:** 9.6% hit rate for radiation references

**Next Steps:**
1. Enhance extraction script to include these tables
2. Re-validate on test patients
3. Deploy updated extraction for BRIM trial
