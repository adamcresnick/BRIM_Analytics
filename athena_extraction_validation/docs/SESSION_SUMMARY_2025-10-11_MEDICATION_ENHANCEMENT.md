# Session Summary: Medication Extraction Enhancement & GitHub Sync

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Commit:** `cdacbb3` - feat: Enhanced medication extraction with comprehensive temporal fields

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ‚úÖ Enhanced Medication Extraction Script

**File Modified:** `athena_extraction_validation/scripts/extract_all_medications_metadata.py`

**Changes:**
- Added direct JOIN to `medication_request` table (was only using patient_medications view)
- Increased columns from 29 ‚Üí **44 fields** (+15 new fields, 52% increase)
- Added 14 critical fields from medication_request table:
  - 6 temporal fields (validity_period_start/end, dispense durations)
  - 6 treatment strategy fields (course_of_therapy, intent, priority)
  - 3 medication change tracking fields (prior_prescription, substitution)

**Impact:**
- **Individual medication stop dates**: 21.5% coverage (was 0%)
- **Treatment strategy classification**: 89.4% coverage (course_of_therapy_type_text)
- **Medication change tracking**: 29.5% coverage (prior_prescription_display)
- **Query performance**: 12.2 seconds (10s query + 1s retrieval) - minimal impact

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive Documentation Created

**New File:** `athena_extraction_validation/docs/MEDICATION_EXTRACTION_ENHANCEMENT_TEMPORAL_FIELDS.md`

**Contents:**
- Executive summary of enhancement
- Schema evolution (before/after comparison)
- Data coverage analysis for all 44 fields
- Chemotherapy agent temporal data examples
- Query architecture and performance metrics
- Clinical applications and recommendations
- Complete field inventory with descriptions

**Size:** 570+ lines of comprehensive documentation

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Archive Structure Created

**New Directory:** `athena_extraction_validation/scripts/_archive/`

**Archived Files (9 scripts):**
1. `test_medication_table.py` - Empty exploration file
2. `test_medication_joins.py` - JOIN pattern testing
3. `test_additional_medication_tables.py` - Child table testing
4. `test_patient_medications.py` - View exploration
5. `count_meds.py` - Quick medication count

## Key Discoveries During Session

### 1. patient_medications is a Materialized View
- Only contains 10 fields (not a full table)
- Doesn't include temporal fields like validity_period_end
- Solution: Direct JOIN to underlying medication_request table

### 2. medication_request Table Has 68 Fields
- Includes validity_period_end for individual stop dates
- Contains treatment strategy context (course_of_therapy_type_text)
- Tracks medication changes via prior_prescription_display
- Has dispense duration fields for supply planning

### 3. Date Coverage Patterns
| Source | Field | Coverage |
|--------|-------|----------|
| patient_medications | authored_on | 100.0% ‚úÖ |
| medication_request | validity_period_end | 21.5% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| care_plan | care_plan_period_end | 0.0% ‚ùå |

**Insight:** Individual medication stop dates sparse but better than care plan dates

### 4. Treatment Strategy Context Excellent
- `course_of_therapy_type_text`: 89.4% coverage
- Distinguishes "Short course (acute)" vs "Continuous long-term"
- Critical for understanding treatment intent

### 5. Medication Change Tracking Available
- `prior_prescription_display`: 29.5% coverage
- Tracks medication switches and substitutions
- Enables treatment evolution analysis

---

## Clinical Impact

### For BRIM Workflow

**Goal 2: Isolate Correct JSON Input** ‚úÖ Enhanced
- Now have 44 structured fields vs 29 fields
- Better temporal context for STRUCTURED_treatments document
- Can track medication changes and treatment strategy

**Goal 3: Enhanced Logic for Dependent Variables** ‚úÖ Improved
- age_at_chemo_stop now calculable for 21.5% of medications
- Treatment duration calculable from supply duration (22.6%)
- Course of therapy classification available (89.4%)

**Goal 4: Hybrid Source Variable Validation** ‚úÖ Enabled
- Structured dates from validity_period_end
- Structured strategy from course_of_therapy_type_text
- Can cross-validate with narrative clinical notes

### For Treatments CSV Generation

**Variables Now Extractable:**
1. ‚úÖ `chemotherapy` - Drug detection (need to fix filter bug)
2. ‚úÖ `chemotherapy_agents` - Drug names with RxNorm codes
3. ‚úÖ `age_at_chemo_start` - From medication_start_date (100%)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `age_at_chemo_stop` - From validity_period_end (21.5%) or calculate from supply duration
5. ‚úÖ `chemotherapy_protocol` - From care_plan_title (10.7%)
6. ‚úÖ `course_of_therapy` - From course_of_therapy_type_text (89.4%)

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Chemotherapy Filter Bug** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
   - Current: 33% recall (finds 1/3 agents)
   - Issue: Only bevacizumab found, missing vinblastine & selumetinib
   - File: `scripts/filter_chemotherapy_from_medications.py`
   - Action: Expand keyword list, test RxNorm matching

2. **Calculate Stop Dates from Supply Duration** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - For medications without validity_period_end (78.5%)
   - Formula: stop_date = medication_start_date + dispense_request_expected_supply_duration
   - Provides additional 22.6% coverage
   - Total potential: 21.5% + 22.6% = 44.1% stop date coverage

3. **Extract Demographics (Race/Ethnicity)** ‚úÖ EASY WIN
   - 100% structured data available
   - Table: patient_access
   - Quick validation possible

### Secondary Priorities

4. **Update STRATEGIC_GOALS_STRUCTURED_DATA_PRIORITY.md**
   - Add medication extraction as example of Goal 2 success
   - Update metrics with new coverage statistics
   - Document temporal field availability

5. **Complete Remaining 11/18 CSV Extractions**
   - molecular_tests, family_history, conditions, etc.
   - Follow patterns from medications extraction

6. **Validate Enhanced Medication Output**
   - Test against gold standard treatments.csv
   - Verify chemotherapy agent detection after filter fix
   - Validate temporal data accuracy

---

## Validation Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Demographics: 100% accuracy (189/189 fields)
- ‚úÖ Diagnosis: 61.4% accuracy (needs improvement)

### In Progress
- üîÑ Medications: Enhanced extraction complete, validation pending
  - Need to fix chemotherapy filter
  - Need to validate temporal fields
