# Session Summary: Procedures Staging File Creation

## Executive Summary

Successfully created comprehensive procedures staging file with deep schema discovery following the same methodology used for encounters. Discovered 22 procedure-related tables, extracted 72 complete procedures with 34 metadata columns, and identified critical data quality issues requiring encounter linkage for date resolution.

**Date**: 2024
**Patient**: C1277724 (FHIR ID: e4BwD8ZYDBccepXcJ.Ilo3w3)
**Database**: fhir_v2_prd_db (AWS Athena)

## Accomplishments

### 1. Schema Discovery ✅

**Discovered 22 Procedure Tables**:
- `procedure` (main - 38 columns)
- `procedure_code_coding` (CPT/HCPCS codes)
- `procedure_category_coding` (surgical vs diagnostic classification)
- `procedure_body_site` (anatomical locations)
- `procedure_performer` (surgeons/providers)
- `procedure_reason_code` (indications)
- `procedure_report` (operative reports linkage)
- 15 additional subtables

**Key Findings**:
- Main procedure table has 38 columns (vs 24 for encounters)
- 98.6% of procedures have structured CPT codes
- 100% have category classification (surgical vs diagnostic)
- 50% link to operative reports (998 total report linkages)

### 2. Extraction Script Created ✅

**File**: `extract_all_procedures_metadata.py` (383 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- Extracts from 7 procedure tables
- Merges on procedure_fhir_id (for downstream linkage)
- Aggregates multiple codes/performers/reports per procedure
- Calculates age_at_procedure_days
- Flags surgical procedures by keyword detection
- Exports complete staging file with 34 columns

**Query Strategy**:
```python
# Main procedures
SELECT id as procedure_fhir_id, status, performed_*, code_text, 
       category_text, encounter_reference, location_reference, ...
FROM procedure WHERE subject_reference = 'PATIENT_FHIR_ID'

# Join with:
- procedure_code_coding (CPT codes)
- procedure_category_coding (surgical classification)
- procedure_body_site (anatomical locations)
- procedure_performer (surgeons)
- procedure_reason_code (indications)
- procedure_report (operative reports)
```

### 3. Procedures Staging File Generated ✅

- **Key codes**: CRANIECTOMY, VENTRICULOCISTERNOSTOMY, STRTCTC CPTR ASSTD PX
- **Expected**: ~3-4 major surgical events (initial resection 2018, recurrence 2021)

**Metadata Coverage**:
```
High Coverage (>80%):
  - category_coding_display: 100%
  - code_coding_display: 98.6%

  - performer_actor_display: 30.6%

Sparse (<30%):
  - performed_period_start: 11% ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE
  - body_site_text: 8.3%
```

### 5. Documentation Created ✅

**PROCEDURES_SCHEMA_DISCOVERY.md** (~10 KB):
- All 22 tables documented
- Main table 38 columns mapped
- 7 key subtables detailed
- Sample queries for surgical identification
- Data quality notes
- Relationship diagrams

**PROCEDURES_STAGING_FILE_ANALYSIS.md** (~12 KB):
- Complete column guide (34 columns)
- Distribution breakdowns
- Surgical procedure deep dive
- Metadata coverage analysis
- Date resolution strategy
- Filtering recommendations
- Validation against clinical timeline
- Known issues documented

## Critical Findings

### 🚨 Issue 1: Sparse Date Coverage (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Problem**: Only 8/72 procedures (11%) have dates in performed_period_start field

**Impact**: 
- Cannot create procedure timeline for 89% of procedures
- Cannot calculate age_at_procedure for undated procedures
- Surgical dates may be missing

**Root Cause**: 
- Procedures may be documented as concepts/orders without explicit timing
- Timing may be implicit via encounter linkage
- Some procedures may be documentation artifacts

**Mitigation Strategy**:
```python
# Priority order for dating:
1. performed_period_start (if not NULL)
2. performed_date_time (if period_start NULL)
3. encounter_date (via encounter_reference linkage) ← CRITICAL
4. report_date (via report_reference → DocumentReference)
5. DiagnosticReport.effective_date (for diagnostic procedures)
```

**Next Steps**:
- Merge procedures with encounters on encounter_reference
- Extract DocumentReference.date for procedures with report_reference
- Manually validate surgical procedure dates against "Surgery Log" encounters

### 🔍 Issue 2: Anesthesia as Separate Procedures

**Finding**: 6 anesthesia procedures found, likely marking 3 surgical events

**Anesthesia Procedure**:
```
ANES PERFORM INJ ANESTHETIC AGENT FEMORAL NERVE SINGLE (x6)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Pre-operative and post-operative anesthesia documented separately
- 6 anesthesia procedures ÷ 2 = 3 probable surgical events
- Must be linked to primary surgical procedures

**Strategy**:
- Use anesthesia dates as markers for surgical events
- Match anesthesia procedures to nearby surgical procedures by date
- Cross-reference with "Surgery Log" encounters (4 found)

### ✅ Success: High Category Coverage

**100% of procedures have category_coding_display**

**Categories**:
- "Surgical procedure" (10) - Authoritative surgical identification
- "Diagnostic procedure" (62) - Non-surgical

**Advantage**: Reliable filtering for surgical vs diagnostic procedures

**Usage**:
```python
surgical = df[df['category_coding_display'] == 'Surgical procedure']
diagnostic = df[df['category_coding_display'] == 'Diagnostic procedure']
```

## Validation Strategy

### Cross-Reference with Encounters

**Objective**: Link procedures to dated encounters to resolve missing dates

**Method**:
```python
# Load both staging files
procedures = pd.read_csv('ALL_PROCEDURES_METADATA_C1277724.csv')
encounters = pd.read_csv('ALL_ENCOUNTERS_METADATA_C1277724.csv')

# Merge on encounter_reference
merged = procedures.merge(
    encounters[['encounter_fhir_id', 'encounter_date', 'class_display', 'age_at_encounter_days']],
    left_on='encounter_reference',
    right_on='encounter_fhir_id',
    how='left'
)

# Filter for surgical events
surgical_events = merged[
    (merged['category_coding_display'] == 'Surgical procedure') &
    (merged['class_display'] == 'Surgery Log')
]

print(f"Surgical procedures with Surgery Log encounters: {len(surgical_events)}")
```

**Expected Result**: 4-6 surgical procedures linked to "Surgery Log" encounters

### Expected Surgical Timeline

**Based on Patient History**:
1. **Initial Diagnosis**: 2018-03-26
2. **Expected Initial Surgery**: ~May 2018 (2-4 weeks post-diagnosis)
3. **Recurrence Diagnosis**: 2021-01-13
4. **Expected Recurrence Surgery**: ~March 2021 (2-4 weeks post-recurrence)

**Validation Checkpoints**:
- [ ] Confirm surgical dates align with diagnosis dates (±2 months)
- [ ] Verify chemotherapy starts 2-4 weeks post-surgery
- [ ] Ensure anesthesia procedures align with surgical dates
- [ ] Cross-check operative report dates

### Surgical Procedure Codes to Validate

| Code Description | Expected Date | Type |
|------------------|---------------|------|
| CRANIECTOMY, CRANIOTOMY POSTERIOR FOSSA...TUMOR RESECTION | ~2018-05-28 | Initial resection |
| STRTCTC CPTR ASSTD PX CRANIAL INTRADURAL | ~2021-03-10 | Recurrence resection |
| VENTRICULOCISTERNOSTOMY 3RD VNTRC * | ~2018 or 2021 | Shunt placement |

## Key Learnings

### 1. Staging File Approach Validated

**Philosophy**: Extract everything first, filter later

**Benefits**:
- Preserved all 72 procedures (including administrative orders)
- Discovered sparse date coverage before implementing filters
- Enabled metadata coverage analysis
- Supports multiple downstream use cases

### 2. Encounter Linkage is Critical

**Finding**: 50% of procedures link to encounters

**Implication**: Must merge procedures with encounters to resolve dates

**Strategy**:
```python
# Procedures without dates can inherit encounter dates
undated_procedures = procedures[procedures['performed_period_start'].isna()]
linked_to_encounters = undated_procedures[undated_procedures['encounter_reference'].notna()]
# Can resolve dates for linked_to_encounters via merge
```

### 3. Anesthesia as Surgical Marker

**Pattern**: Anesthesia procedures documented separately from primary surgeries

**Usage**: 
- 6 anesthesia procedures likely indicate 3 surgical events
- Use anesthesia dates to locate surgical events
- Particularly useful when primary procedure lacks explicit date

### 4. Category Coding is Gold Standard

**Finding**: 100% coverage for category_coding_display

**Reliability**: 
- "Surgical procedure" category is authoritative
- More reliable than keyword detection
- Should be primary filter for surgical identification

**Validation**: Keyword detection found 11 vs 10 categorized surgical procedures (difference = anesthesia)

### 5. Operative Reports are Well-Linked

**Finding**: 50% of procedures have report_reference (998 total linkages)

**Opportunity**:
- Extract DocumentReference IDs
- Query for report dates and content
- Use report dates as fallback for procedure timing
- Access operative notes for surgical details
