Rayan Khan is an 12 y.o. boy with gliomatosis cerebri, s/p biopsy and tumor debulking. We had a long and
detailed discussion with Rayan and his parents regarding radiation, and explained our recommendation that
he receive a course of radiation to the partial brain with the goal of slowing disease progression for as long as
possible. The risks, benefits, and rationale for this treatment were discussed in detail. Informed consent was
signed and CT simulation performed. Rayan tolerated treatment very well, with only the mild and expected
side effects outlined below.
