# Patient Clinical Journey Timeline Framework - Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Session Focus**: Stepwise timeline construction + imaging extraction integration + MedGemma orchestration architecture

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Stepwise Timeline Construction Implementation**

Enhanced `patient_timeline_abstraction_V1.py` to follow explicit stepwise staging approach per user requirement: **"starting with encounters/appointments, then procedures, then chemotherapy, then radiation (all after defining the molecular diagnosis)"**

**7-Stage Timeline Construction**:
- **Stage 0**: Molecular diagnosis (WHO 2021 anchor) - establishes expected treatment paradigm
- **Stage 1**: Encounters/appointments - validates care coordination
- **Stage 2**: Procedures (surgeries) - validates against tumor biology
- **Stage 3**: Chemotherapy episodes - validates regimen against WHO 2021 recommendations
- **Stage 4**: Radiation episodes - validates dose/fields against WHO 2021 paradigms
- **Stage 5**: Imaging studies - assesses surveillance adherence
- **Stage 6**: Pathology granular records - links molecular findings to timeline

**Protocol Validation at Each Stage**:
- Expected protocols (from WHO 2021 classification) shown alongside actual treatments
- Warnings displayed when treatments missing or deviate from expected paradigm
- Example: "ðŸ“‹ Expected per WHO 2021: High-dose platinum-based (cisplatin/cyclophosphamide/etoposide)"

---

### 2. **Imaging Report Extraction Integration**

Per user reminder: **"don't forget that you/medgemma need extract the imaging report text from v_imaging"**

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated imaging query to include:
   - `result_diagnostic_report_id` (FHIR ID for MedGemma targeting)
   - `diagnostic_report_id` (alternative FHIR ID)

2. Enhanced Stage 5 (imaging studies) to capture diagnostic report IDs in timeline events

3. Updated gap identification (Phase 3) to:
   - Detect vague imaging conclusions (NULL, empty, <50 characters)
   - Include `medgemma_target` field for binary extraction
   - Include `diagnostic_report_id` for targeting specific reports

**Result**: All 140 imaging studies for Pineoblastoma patient flagged for extraction (vague conclusions)

---

### 3. **Comprehensive MedGemma Orchestration Architecture**

Created **MEDGEMMA_ORCHESTRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md** (40+ pages) documenting:

**Core Principle**: **ALL free text and binary documents should be abstracted by MedGemma using dynamically-generated, context-aware prompts from Claude**

**Two-Agent Architecture**:
- **Claude (orchestrating agent)**: Analyzes patient timeline, generates specialized prompts, integrates extractions
- **MedGemma (extraction agent)**: Extracts structured data from binaries using Claude's prompts

**Document Types for Extraction**:
1. Pathology reports (Priority 1-2 documents)
2. Surgical/operative notes (ALL surgeries - missing EOR is CRITICAL gap)
3. Radiation treatment summaries (missing dose/fields)
4. Imaging reports (vague conclusions requiring full report)
5. Chemotherapy notes (dosing, cycles, toxicities)
6. Clinical notes (future integration)

**Context-Aware Prompt Generation**:
- Claude generates specialized prompts based on:
  - WHO 2021 molecular diagnosis
  - Timeline phase (post-surgery, during treatment, surveillance)
  - Expected clinical information needs
  - Known gaps from structured data

**3 Detailed Prompt Examples Created**:
1. **Post-surgical pathology report**: Extract EOR + molecular markers for Pineoblastoma patient
2. **Post-radiation MRI (pseudoprogression window)**: Extract tumor measurements + pseudoprogression features
3. **Operative note**: Extract extent of resection (GTR/STR/biopsy) with categorization rules

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. **Correct Column Names from Schema**
- Used Athena_Schema_10302025.csv to ensure exact column names
- v_chemo_treatment_episodes: `episode_start_datetime` (NOT episode_start_date)
- v_radiation_episode_enrichment: `episode_start_date` (correct)
- v_imaging: `result_diagnostic_report_id` + `diagnostic_report_id` (for MedGemma targeting)

### 2. **Leveraged Existing extraction_priority Framework**
- From DATETIME_STANDARDIZED_VIEWS.sql (lines 4978-5009, 7338-7382)
- 5-tier prioritization (Priority 1 = highest value documents)
- Used in gap identification for targeting high-value documents

### 3. **WHO 2021 Classifications Embedded**
- All 9 patients from previous molecular abstraction work
- Embedded in `WHO_2021_CLASSIFICATIONS` dict in script
- No re-extraction needed - leverages existing work as instructed

### 4. **Stage-by-Stage Validation**
- Each treatment stage validates against molecular-specific WHO 2021 expected paradigms
- Deviations flagged immediately with clinical significance
- Example: Missing chemotherapy when Pineoblastoma requires aggressive chemo

### 5. **MedGemma Target Fields**
- All extraction gaps include `medgemma_target` field
- Format: `DiagnosticReport/{diagnostic_report_id}` for imaging
- Ready for Phase 4 binary extraction implementation

## What's Ready for Implementation

### Phase 4: MedGemma Binary Extraction (PLACEHOLDER)

The framework is **fully designed and documented** but Phase 4 is a placeholder. When ready to implement:

1. **Extraction gaps identified** with `medgemma_target` fields
2. **Placeholder method** (`_phase4_extract_from_binaries_placeholder()`) ready to be replaced
3. **Prompt generation framework** documented with 3 detailed examples
4. **Integration logic** defined for merging extractions back into timeline
5. **Re-assessment strategy** for iterative gap resolution

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Implement `_generate_medgemma_prompt(gap)` - generates context-aware prompts
2. Implement `_fetch_binary_document(fhir_id)` - fetches DiagnosticReport/Procedure/etc binaries
3. Implement `_call_medgemma(document, prompt)` - calls MedGemma API/service
4. Implement `_integrate_extraction_into_timeline(gap, result)` - merges extractions
5. Implement `_reassess_gaps_post_extraction()` - iterative gap detection

---

## Next Steps (User Decision)

The framework is production-ready for:
1. **Running on all 9 patients** to generate complete timeline artifacts (Phases 1-3)
2. **Implementing Phase 4 (MedGemma integration)** using the documented architecture
3. **Creating additional prompt templates** for specific clinical scenarios
4. **Enhancing gap prioritization** with temporal context (days from surgery/radiation)
5. **Adding RANO criteria automation** for imaging response assessment
