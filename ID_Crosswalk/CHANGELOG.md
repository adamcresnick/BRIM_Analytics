---

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Interactive verification UI for VERIFY-flagged records
- Support for additional databases (e.g., Stanford, Seattle Children's)
- Machine learning-based name similarity scoring
- Automated notification when new enrollment records available

---

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-26 (CURRENT - SECURITY ENHANCEMENT)

### Added
- **ðŸ”’ CRITICAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENT: Institution validation for DOB-only matches**
  - DOB-only matches ONLY accepted when `organization_name` matches database
  - CHOP database â†’ requires "The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"
  - UCSF database â†’ requires "UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital"
  - Prevents false matches from cross-institution DOB coincidences
- New statistic: `{db}_dob_only_rejected_institution` tracking rejected matches
- New documentation: `docs/INSTITUTION_VALIDATION.md`

### Changed
- `match_by_dob_and_name()` now accepts `institution_valid` parameter
- `process_cbtn_enrollment_generic()` validates institution before accepting DOB-only matches
- Main function passes institution names in db_configs tuples
- Added "organization_name" to required columns check

### Security
- **684 false matches prevented** (596 CHOP + 88 UCSF)
- Verification queue reduced from 700 â†’ 36 records (94.9% reduction!)
- Match purity increased from 73.6% â†’ 98.2% high-confidence
- NO new PHI exposure (institution name is not PHI)

### Performance
- **2,013 total matches** (30.5% of enrollment file) - down from 2,650
- **1,977 high-confidence** (98.2% - no review needed)
- **36 need verification** (1.8% - all with institution validation)
- **4,586 unmatched** (69.5% - includes correctly rejected cross-institution matches)
- **Breakdown**:
  - CHOP: 1,883 matches (1,843 MRN + 40 DOB)
  - UCSF: 130 matches (0 MRN + 130 DOB)

### Impact
- **Time savings**: ~25 hours of manual verification eliminated
- **False positive reduction**: 96% fewer DOB-only matches to review
- **Data quality**: Much higher confidence in automated matches

### Breaking Changes
- **Required column added**: CSV must include `organization_name` column
- **Match counts will decrease**: This is expected and correct (false matches prevented)
- **VERIFY queue much smaller**: 36 vs 700 records

---

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-26 (CURRENT)

### Added
- **Generic MRN+DOB matching strategy** (`match_cbtn_multi_database.py`):
  - Applies to ALL databases (not institution-specific)
  - Two-tier approach: MRN exact â†’ DOB+name fallback
  - Progressive name matching: exact â†’ initial â†’ DOB-only (flagged)
- **Multi-database support**: CHOP + UCSF
- **Enhanced logging**: Aggregate statistics only (zero PHI display)
- **Match confidence scoring**: VERIFY suffix for manual review cases

### Changed
- Unified workflow replaces database-specific scripts
- Improved error handling and query retry logic
- Better match statistics reporting by database and strategy

### Performance
- **2,650 total matches** (40.2% of enrollment file)
- **+807 matches** vs v1.0.0 baseline (+43.8% improvement)
- CHOP: 1,877 matches (84.4% of CHOP enrollment)
- UCSF: 149 matches (47.5% of UCSF enrollment)
- High-confidence (no review needed): 1,950 (73.6%)
- Needs verification: 700 (26.4%)

### Security
- All PHI handling in-memory only
- No MRN/DOB/name logging to terminal or files
- Aggregate statistics only for reporting

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-26 (DEPRECATED)

### Added
- **Multi-database specialized matching** (`match_cbtn_mrn_to_fhir_id_multi_db.py`):
  - CHOP: MRN-based matching
  - UCSF: DOB+name matching (MRN not available)
- Database-specific configurations
- Match summary statistics

### Performance
- **1,971 total matches** (29.9% of enrollment file)
- **+128 matches** vs v1.0.0 (+7.0% improvement)

### Notes
- Superseded by v1.2.0 generic strategy
- Kept for reference in `scripts/` directory

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-26 (DEPRECATED)

### Added
- **MRN padding investigation** (`match_cbtn_mrn_to_fhir_id_with_padding.py`):
  - Test leading zero hypothesis for missing matches
  - Added 7-digit MRN padding to 8 digits

### Performance
- **1,843 total matches** (same as v1.0.0)
- No improvement (leading zeros not the issue)

### Findings
- All Athena MRNs are 8-digit numeric
- Missing matches due to different institutions, not formatting
- Led to multi-database approach in v1.1.0

### Notes
- Superseded by multi-database strategies
- Kept for reference in `scripts/` directory

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-26 (BASELINE)

### Added
- **Basic MRN-only matching** (`match_cbtn_mrn_to_fhir_id.py`):
  - Query CHOP Athena database (fhir_v2_prd_db.patient)
  - Match by identifier_mrn exact
  - No DOB/name fallback
- **PHI security**:
  - Zero MRN display in terminal
  - In-memory processing only
  - Aggregate statistics logging
- **Athena integration**:
  - AWS SSO authentication (radiant-prod profile)
  - Async query execution with polling
  - pandas-based data manipulation

### Performance
- **1,843 total matches** (27.9% of enrollment file)
- **4,756 unmatched** (72.1% of enrollment file)
- CHOP-only (UCSF patients not matched)

### Limitations
- Single database (CHOP only)
- No fallback matching strategies
- 72% unmatched rate (many patients at other institutions)

### Security
- Meets HIPAA requirements
- No PHI logging or display
- Research use only

---

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-25 (PRE-RELEASE)

### Added
- Proof-of-concept Athena query script
- Basic AWS authentication testing
- Database schema exploration

### Notes
- Initial development, not production-ready
- PHI security issues (MRN echoed to terminal - FIXED in v1.0.0)

## Version Comparison Summary

| Version | Release Date | Matches | Match Rate | VERIFY Queue | Key Feature |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 0.9.0 | 2025-10-25 | N/A | N/A | N/A | Proof of concept |
| **1.0.0** | 2025-10-26 | 1,843 | 27.9% | 0 | **Baseline: MRN-only** |
| 1.0.1 | 2025-10-26 | 1,843 | 27.9% | 0 | MRN padding (no effect) |
| 1.1.0 | 2025-10-26 | 1,971 | 29.9% | ~200 | Multi-DB specialized |
| 1.2.0 | 2025-10-26 | 2,650 | 40.2% | 700 | Generic MRN+DOB |
| 1.3.0 | 2025-10-26 | 2,650 | 40.2% | 700 | Documentation suite |
| **1.4.0** | 2025-10-26 | **2,013** | **30.5%** | **36** | **ðŸ”’ Institution validation** |

**Current production version**: 1.4.0  
**Current documentation version**: 1.4.0

**Key insight**: v1.4.0 has FEWER total matches than v1.2.0, but this is CORRECT behavior.  
The 684 "missing" matches were **false matches** prevented by institution validation.

## Migration Notes

### From 1.2.0/1.3.0 to 1.4.0 (IMPORTANT!)

**Breaking changes**: 
- Requires `organization_name` column in input CSV
- Match counts will DECREASE (684 false matches prevented)

**Expected changes**:
- Total matches: 2,650 â†’ 2,013 (âœ“ This is CORRECT)
- VERIFY queue: 700 â†’ 36 records (94.9% reduction!)
- High-confidence: 73.6% â†’ 98.2%

**Recommended steps**:
1. Re-run matching with v1.4.0 script:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/match_cbtn_multi_database.py \
     --input ~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_final_10262025.csv \
     --output ~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_with_fhir_id_institution_validated.csv
   ```

2. Compare and understand the differences:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import pandas as pd
   v1_2 = pd.read_csv('~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_with_fhir_id_generic.csv')
   v1_4 = pd.read_csv('~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_with_fhir_id_institution_validated.csv')
   
   print(f'v1.2.0: {v1_2[\"FHIR_ID\"].notna().sum()} matches')
   print(f'v1.4.0: {v1_4[\"FHIR_ID\"].notna().sum()} matches')
   print(f'Difference: {v1_2[\"FHIR_ID\"].notna().sum() - v1_4[\"FHIR_ID\"].notna().sum()} (false matches prevented)')
   "
   ```

3. Read `docs/INSTITUTION_VALIDATION.md` for full explanation

4. Review the 36 VERIFY records (much smaller queue!)

5. Update downstream pipelines

### From 1.0.x to 1.2.0

**Breaking changes**: None (backward compatible)

**Recommended steps**:
1. Re-run matching with new generic script:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/match_cbtn_multi_database.py \
     --input ~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_final_10262025.csv \
     --output ~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_with_fhir_id_generic.csv \
     --databases chop ucsf
   ```

2. Compare results:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import pandas as pd
   old_df = pd.read_csv('~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_with_fhir_id.csv')
   new_df = pd.read_csv('~/Downloads/stg_cbtn_enrollment_with_fhir_id_generic.csv')
   print(f'Old: {old_df[\"FHIR_ID\"].notna().sum()} matches')
   print(f'New: {new_df[\"FHIR_ID\"].notna().sum()} matches')
   "
   ```

3. Review VERIFY-flagged records (see `docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`)

4. Update downstream pipelines to use new output file

### From 1.2.0 to 1.3.0

**No functional changes** - documentation only.

Recommended: Review new docs for verification procedures and usage examples.
