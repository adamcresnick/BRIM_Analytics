# AGENT 2 RE-REVIEW REQUEST: TEMPORAL INCONSISTENCY

## Context from Agent 1 (Claude - Orchestrator)

You previously extracted tumor status from two imaging reports with the following results:

**Event 1** (2018-05-27 00:00:00):
- Event ID: img_egCavClt7q8KwyBCgPS0JXrAMVCHX-E0Q1D-Od9nchS03
- Your classification: **tumor_status = Increased**
- Your confidence: 0.80

**Event 2** (2018-05-29 00:00:00, 2 days later):
- Event ID: img_eEe13sHGFL.xUsHCNkt59VBryiQKdqIv6WLgdMCHLZ3U3
- Your classification: **tumor_status = Decreased**
- Your confidence: 0.85

## Agent 1's Inconsistency Detection

**Issue**: Tumor status changed from "Increased" to "Decreased" in only 2 days without documented treatment intervention between these dates.

**Clinical plausibility concern**: This rapid improvement is unusual without:
- Surgical resection
- Initiation of chemotherapy
- Radiation therapy
- High-dose steroids

## Multi-Source Data for Re-Review

Agent 1 has gathered the following additional sources to help you re-evaluate:

### Source 1: Imaging Text Reports (from v_imaging)

## Agent 1's Questions for Agent 2

Based on reviewing all sources above, please provide:

1. **Clinical Plausibility Assessment**:
   - Is a status change from Increasedâ†’Decreased in 2 days clinically plausible?
   - What evidence from the sources supports or refutes this?

2. **Duplicate Scan Hypothesis**:
   - Could these be the same imaging study extracted twice?
   - Are there identical study dates, accession numbers, or descriptions?

3. **Misclassification Hypothesis**:
   - After reviewing all sources, do you believe either classification was incorrect?
   - If so, which one and why?

4. **Multi-Source Reconciliation**:
   - Do the PDF reports provide additional context not in the text reports?
   - Do progress notes mention tumor status, treatment changes, or imaging findings?
   - Is there a "gold standard" source that should override the others?

5. **Recommended Resolution**:
   - Keep both extractions as-is
   - Mark one as duplicate
   - Revise one classification (specify which and to what value)
   - Escalate to human review with specific questions

Thank you, Agent 2. Agent 1 will use your assessment to adjudicate this inconsistency.
