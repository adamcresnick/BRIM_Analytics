# Session Summary: October 22, 2025
## Chemotherapy & Radiation Treatment Data Infrastructure

---

## Executive Summary

Today we accomplished significant work across **TWO major treatment modalities**: chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Both now have comprehensive Athena views deployed and detailed integration designs, ready for implementation into the multi-source abstraction workflow.

---

## 1. CHEMOTHERAPY WORK (Primary Focus Today)

### ✅ Athena Views Deployed and Working

**All views using `patient_fhir_id` column consistently**

#### v_chemo_medications
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND WORKING
- **Records**: 116,903+ medication orders
- **Coverage**: ~89% date coverage using `dosage_instruction_timing_repeat_bounds_period`
- **Features**:
  - Matches both ingredient-level AND product-level RxNorm codes
  - Comprehensive drug reference (3,064 drugs from RADIANT unified index)
  - Improved medication timing (was 16%, now 89%)
  - Includes route, dosage, method, site
  - Links to care plans
- **File**: [athena_views/views/V_CHEMO_MEDICATIONS.sql](../athena_views/views/V_CHEMO_MEDICATIONS.sql)

#### v_concomitant_medications
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND WORKING
- **Records**: 192,488,219 temporal overlap records
- **Features**:
  - Temporal overlap analysis (during_chemo, started_during_chemo, stopped_during_chemo, spans_chemo)
  - Categorizes concomitant meds: antiemetic, corticosteroid, growth_factor, anticonvulsant, etc.
  - Date quality indicators (high/medium/low)
  - Validates chemotherapy administration via expected supportive care
- **File**: [athena_views/views/DATETIME_STANDARDIZED_VIEWS.sql](../athena_views/views/DATETIME_STANDARDIZED_VIEWS.sql) (lines 448-826)

#### v_chemotherapy_drugs
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND WORKING (External Table)
- **Records**: 3,064 comprehensive chemotherapy drugs
- **Source**: S3-backed external table
- **Data**: FDA-approved + investigational agents from RADIANT unified index
- **File**: [athena_views/views/COMPREHENSIVE_CHEMOTHERAPY_VIEWS_DEPLOYMENT.sql](../athena_views/views/COMPREHENSIVE_CHEMOTHERAPY_VIEWS_DEPLOYMENT.sql)
- **S3 Location**: `s3://radiant-prd-343218191717-us-east-1-prd-athena-results/chemotherapy_reference/drugs/`

#### v_chemotherapy_rxnorm_codes
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND WORKING (External Table)
- **Records**: 2,804 product→ingredient RxNorm mappings
- **Purpose**: Maps product-level codes to ingredient-level codes for comprehensive matching
- **S3 Location**: `s3://radiant-prd-343218191717-us-east-1-prd-athena-results/chemotherapy_reference/rxnorm/`

#### v_chemotherapy_regimens
- **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED (External Table)
- **Records**: 814 defined chemotherapy regimens
- **Purpose**: Standard regimen definitions for matching drug combinations
- **S3 Location**: `s3://radiant-prd-343218191717-us-east-1-prd-athena-results/chemotherapy_reference/regimens/`

### Critical Fixes Applied Today

1. **RxNorm Code Format Issue** (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
   - **Problem**: RxNorm codes stored with `.0` decimal suffix (`253337.0`) didn't match medication data (`253337`)
   - **Impact**: 0 matches initially → 87,747 matches after fix
   - **Solution**: Removed `.0` suffixes from all CSV files and re-uploaded to S3

2. **Medication Reference Join Issue** (CRITICAL BUG FIX)
   - **Problem**: Using `SUBSTRING(mr.medication_reference_reference, 12)` assumed "Medication/" prefix that doesn't exist
   - **Impact**: 0 records returned from views
   - **Solution**: Changed to direct ID match: `m.id = mr.medication_reference_reference`

3. **External Table Schema Mismatch**
   - **Problem**: Missing `is_supportive_care` column in external table definition
   - **Solution**: Dropped and recreated tables with correct schema

4. **S3 File Organization**
   - **Problem**: All CSV files in single directory causing schema confusion
   - **Solution**: Organized into subdirectories: `drugs/`, `rxnorm/`, `regimens/`

5. **Missing medication_reason Column**
   - **Problem**: View referenced `mr.reason_reference_display` which doesn't exist in medication_request table
   - **Solution**: Added CTE for `medication_request_reason_reference` table join

## 6. KEY INSIGHTS & DECISIONS

### Chemotherapy Extraction Decisions (User-Confirmed)

1. **Timing Sensitivity**: Use infusion/administration dates when available, fall back to medication_request dates
2. **Missing Data Handling**: Include all chemotherapy courses with clear data source and binary confirmation status in JSON
3. **Clinical Trial Enrollment**: Accept documentation in notes, care plans, or other documents as sufficient for "protocol" or "like protocol" status
4. **Regimen Assignment**: Use "like regimen" nomenclature when drugs match but timing differs (analogous to "like protocol")
5. **Multiple Courses**: Separate course_ids unless documentation shows it's a defined sequential regimen

### Technical Insights

1. **medication_request represents ORDERS, not administration** - Need infusion records to validate actual delivery
2. **Concomitant medications validate chemotherapy** - Absence of expected supportive care may indicate data quality issues
3. **Clinical trial enrollment requires binary extraction** - Protocol numbers and treatment arms rarely in structured FHIR data
4. **Therapy modifications documented in progress notes** - Dose reductions, delays, discontinuations often only in free text
5. **Timing windows must be expanded** - Clinicians may document changes days/weeks before formal orders reflect them

### Data Quality Improvements

**Chemotherapy Date Coverage**:
- **Before**: 16% coverage using `authored_on`
- **After**: 89% coverage using `dosage_instruction_timing_repeat_bounds_period`
- **Impact**: Can now accurately build treatment timelines

**Chemotherapy Drug Reference**:
- **Before**: 11 hardcoded RxNorm codes
- **After**: 3,064 comprehensive drugs from RADIANT unified index
- **Impact**: Captures investigational agents, rare drugs, combination therapies

**RxNorm Matching**:
- **Before**: 0 matches (due to `.0` suffix bug)
- **After**: 87,747 medication records matched
- **Impact**: Can now identify ALL chemotherapy in dataset

## 11. RECOMMENDED NEXT SESSION PLAN

**Session Focus**: Implement JSON builders for both modalities

**Priority Order**:
1. Implement radiation JSON builder (simpler - fewer moving parts)
2. Test radiation extraction on `Patient/e4BwD8ZYDBccepXcJ.Ilo3w3`
3. Implement chemotherapy JSON builder (more complex - regimen matching, timing windows)
4. Test chemotherapy extraction on `Patient/eLiG6.0hbwU-5ljD0B4hUh5heq3ipPk3TILjYLt4l6P43`
5. Integrate both into run_full_multi_source_abstraction.py
6. Rebuild DuckDB timeline database

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours for both JSON builders + testing

---

## 12. QUESTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION

1. Should we implement both JSON builders in parallel or sequentially?
2. Do you want to review the JSON output format before proceeding with integration?
3. Should we add any additional validation checks beyond what's documented?
4. Do you want to test on additional patients before integration?
