# Work Completion Summary

## Session Overview

This document summarizes all work completed in the current session for integrating radiation/chemotherapy extraction and operative note handling into the clinical data extraction workflow.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. **Radiation/Chemotherapy Integration Fix**
**Files Modified**: [scripts/run_full_multi_source_abstraction.py](scripts/run_full_multi_source_abstraction.py#L403-L405)

**What Was Done**:
- Added radiation and chemotherapy data as top-level keys in comprehensive JSON output
- Previously, radiation and chemotherapy were extracted in PHASE 1-PRE but never included in final output
- Now they are properly integrated

**Code Added** (lines 403-405):
```python
# Add radiation and chemotherapy to comprehensive summary
comprehensive_summary['radiation'] = radiation_json if radiation_json else {'error': 'No radiation data available'}
comprehensive_summary['chemotherapy'] = chemo_json if chemo_json else {'error': 'No chemotherapy data available'}
```

**Impact**: Comprehensive JSON now includes complete radiation and chemotherapy treatment history

---

### 2. **Operative Note Multi-Format Query Enhancement**
**Files Modified**: [scripts/run_full_multi_source_abstraction.py](scripts/run_full_multi_source_abstraction.py#L477-L567)

**What Was Done**:
- Updated operative note querying to support ALL content types (not just PDFs)
- Added content type filters: `text/plain`, `text/html`, `application/pdf`
- Expanded document type matching to include category-based filters
- Renamed variable from `operative_notes_pdfs` ‚Üí `operative_note_documents` for accuracy

**Query Enhancement**:
```sql
AND (
    content_type = 'text/plain'
    OR content_type = 'text/html'
    OR content_type = 'application/pdf'
)
AND (
    dr_type_text LIKE 'OP Note%'
    OR dr_type_text = 'Operative Record'
    OR dr_type_text = 'Anesthesia Postprocedure Evaluation'
    OR LOWER(dr_category_text) LIKE '%operative%'     -- NEW
    OR LOWER(dr_category_text) LIKE '%surgical%'      -- NEW
)
```

**Impact**: Operative notes in ANY format (PDF, HTML, plain text) are now queried and matched to surgeries

---

### 3. **ExtractionQualityReviewer Agent Created**
**Files Created**: [agents/extraction_quality_reviewer.py](agents/extraction_quality_reviewer.py)

**What Was Done**:
- Created comprehensive Agent 1 quality review class with methods for:
  - **Process summary generation**: Human-readable summary of extraction process
  - **Deep log analysis**: Identifies failure patterns (S3 errors, token expiration, parsing failures)
  - **Gap analysis**: Compares Phase 1 queries vs successful extractions
  - **Failure pattern detection**: Categorizes retryable vs non-retryable failures
  - **Prioritized note coverage review**: Analyzes if critical clinical events have progress note coverage
  - **Extraction correction attempts**: Framework for Agent 1 ‚Üí Agent 2 retry loop

**Key Methods**:
- `generate_extraction_summary()`: Executive summary with successes/failures/recommendations
- `analyze_extraction_gaps()`: Compares queried vs extracted source counts
- `deep_analyze_failures()`: Parses logs for error patterns
- `review_prioritized_notes()`: Analyzes surgery/imaging/medication coverage
- `attempt_extraction_corrections()`: Retry framework (implementation pending)

**Impact**: Foundation for comprehensive Agent 1 post-extraction quality control

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETED / WORK IN PROGRESS

### 4. **Operative Note Extraction in PHASE 2**
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALREADY EXISTS in current workflow

**Discovery**: Upon detailed code review, operative note extraction IS implemented in PHASE 2C (lines 1089-1269).

**How It Works**:
1. For each surgery in `operative_reports` (from v_procedures_tumor)
2. Query v_binary_files for operative note documents matching surgery date
3. Use tiered matching: Exact date ‚Üí ¬±3 days fallback ‚Üí Perioperative Records fallback
4. Extract text via BinaryFileAgent (handles PDF/HTML/text automatically)
5. Extract EOR and tumor location using MedGemma
6. Add to comprehensive JSON

**Issue Identified**: The Phase 1C-DOCUMENTS query we added queries ALL operative notes, but Phase 2C only processes operative notes that match surgeries. This is actually CORRECT behavior - we want operative notes tied to surgical procedures.

**What's Missing**: Update Phase 1 data_query summary to include operative_note_documents count

---

## ‚ùå NOT COMPLETED

### 5. **Update data_query Phase Summary**
**Status**: NOT DONE

**What's Needed**:
Add `operative_note_documents_count` to the data_query phase summary:

```python
comprehensive_summary['phases']['data_query'] = {
    'imaging_text_count': len(imaging_text_reports),
    'imaging_pdf_count': len(imaging_pdfs),
    'operative_report_count': len(operative_reports),
    'operative_note_documents_count': len(operative_note_documents),  # ADD THIS
    'progress_note_all_count': len(all_progress_notes),
    'progress_note_oncology_count': len(oncology_notes),
    'progress_note_prioritized_count': len(prioritized_notes),
    'total_sources': total_sources
}
```

**Impact**: Tracking and logging will show how many operative note documents were queried

---

### 6. **Integrate ExtractionQualityReviewer as PHASE 7**
**Status**: NOT DONE

**What's Needed**:
Add PHASE 7 section to workflow that:
1. Calls `ExtractionQualityReviewer` after all extractions complete
2. Generates process summary
3. Performs deep log analysis
4. Identifies gaps and failures
5. Generates recommendations
6. Optionally attempts corrections with Agent 2

**Estimated Code**:
```python
# ================================================================
# PHASE 7: AGENT 1 POST-EXTRACTION QUALITY REVIEW
# ================================================================
print("="*80)
print("PHASE 7: AGENT 1 POST-EXTRACTION QUALITY REVIEW")
print("="*80)

from agents.extraction_quality_reviewer import ExtractionQualityReviewer

reviewer = ExtractionQualityReviewer(medgemma_agent=medgemma)

# Generate summary
summary = reviewer.generate_extraction_summary(
    comprehensive_summary,
    workflow_log_path=Path(f"data/patient_abstractions/{timestamp}/workflow_log.json")
)

# Analyze gaps
gaps = reviewer.analyze_extraction_gaps(
    phase1_data=comprehensive_summary['phases']['data_query'],
    successful_extractions=all_extractions
)

# Deep analyze failures
failures = reviewer.deep_analyze_failures(
    log_file_path=Path(f"/tmp/workflow_log.log"),
    comprehensive_data=comprehensive_summary
)

# Add to comprehensive summary
comprehensive_summary['phases']['quality_review'] = {
    'summary': summary,
    'gaps': gaps,
    'failures': failures
}

# Print summary to user
print("\nExtraction Process Summary:")
print(f"  Total sources queried: {summary['executive_summary']['total_sources_queried']}")
print(f"  Successful extractions: {summary['executive_summary']['total_successful_extractions']}")
print(f"  Success rate: {summary['executive_summary']['extraction_success_rate']}")
print(f"\nRecommendations:")
for rec in summary['recommendations']:
    print(f"  [{rec['priority']}] {rec['action']}: {rec['reason']}")
```

**Impact**: Comprehensive post-extraction quality analysis with actionable recommendations

---

### 7. **Add `all_locations_mentioned_normalized` Field**
**Status**: NOT DONE

**What's Needed**:
In tumor location extraction results, add a normalized version of `all_locations_mentioned` using standardized CBTN location codes.

**Current State**: Only `tumor_location_normalized` exists (for primary location)

**Desired State**: Also have `all_locations_mentioned_normalized` (for all mentioned locations)

---

## üîç KEY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Operative Note Extraction Already Works
**Discovery**: Phase 2C (lines 1089-1269) already extracts operative notes from surgeries.

**Current Workflow**:
1. Phase 1C queries surgeries from v_procedures_tumor
2. Phase 2C iterates through surgeries
3. For each surgery, queries v_binary_files for matching operative note
4. Extracts EOR and tumor location from operative note text

**Why It Looked Missing**:
- Previous session's extraction showed `"operative": 0`
- This was due to AWS SSO token expiration (after 2.5 hours)
- NOT because extraction wasn't implemented

### Finding 2: Content Type Handling Is Automatic
**Discovery**: BinaryFileAgent automatically routes extraction based on content_type:
- `application/pdf` ‚Üí PyMuPDF extraction
- `text/html`, `text/plain`, `text/rtf` ‚Üí BeautifulSoup extraction

**Location**: [agents/binary_file_agent.py](agents/binary_file_agent.py#L294-L300)

No additional work needed for multi-format support - it's already built in!

### Finding 3: Token Expiration Is the Real Problem
**Discovery**: From log analysis, AWS SSO token expired at 04:40 (2.5 hours into extraction), causing ALL subsequent extractions to fail.

**Impact**:
- ALL 14 prioritized progress notes failed
- ALL remaining PDFs failed
- Operative notes failed (but would have worked with valid token)

**Recommendation**: Priority fix should be implementing token refresh in BinaryFileAgent

---

## üìã RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

1. **‚úÖ QUICK WIN**: Update data_query phase summary to include operative_note_documents_count (5 minutes)

2. **üîß HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement AWS SSO token refresh in BinaryFileAgent (30 minutes)
   - Add token refresh logic to `stream_binary_from_s3()`
   - Handle TokenRetrievalError exceptions
   - Auto-refresh when token expires

3. **üìä HIGH PRIORITY**: Integrate PHASE 7 quality review (1-2 hours)
   - Add ExtractionQualityReviewer to workflow
   - Generate process summaries
   - Log recommendations

4. **üè∑Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Add `all_locations_mentioned_normalized` field (30 minutes)
   - Extend tumor location extraction to normalize all mentioned locations
   - Add to extraction results

5. **üß™ TESTING**: End-to-end workflow test with valid SSO token
   - Verify operative notes extract successfully
   - Verify progress notes extract successfully
   - Confirm radiation/chemotherapy appear in comprehensive JSON
